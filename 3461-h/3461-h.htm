<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>It is hardly necessary to apologise for the miscellaneous
character of the following collection of essays.&nbsp; Samuel
Butler was a man of such unusual versatility, and his interests
were so many and so various that his literary remains were bound
to cover a wide field.&nbsp; Nevertheless it will be found that
several of the subjects to which he devoted much time and labour
are not represented in these pages.&nbsp; I have not thought it
necessary to reprint any of the numerous pamphlets and articles
which he wrote upon the Iliad and Odyssey, since these were all
merged in &ldquo;The Authoress of the Odyssey,&rdquo; which gives
his matured views upon everything relating to the Homeric
poems.&nbsp; For a similar reason I have not included an essay on
the evidence for the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, which he
printed in 1865 for private circulation, since he subsequently
made extensive use of it in &ldquo;The Fair Haven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two of the essays in this collection were originally delivered
as lectures; the remainder were published in <i>The Universal
Review</i> during 1888, 1889, and 1890.</p>
<p>I should perhaps explain why two other essays of his, which
also appeared in <i>The Universal Review</i>, have been
omitted.</p>
<p>The first of these, entitled &ldquo;L&rsquo;Affaire
Holbein-Rippel,&rdquo; relates to a drawing of Holbein&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Danse des Paysans,&rdquo; in the Basle Museum, which is
usually described as a copy, but which Butler believed to be the
work of Holbein himself.&nbsp; This essay requires to be
illustrated in so elaborate a manner that it was impossible to
include it in a book of this size.</p>
<p>The second essay, which is a sketch of the career of the
sculptor Tabachetti, was published as the first section of an
article entitled &ldquo;A Sculptor and a Shrine,&rdquo; of which
the second section is here given under the title, &ldquo;The
Sanctuary of Montrigone.&rdquo;&nbsp; The section devoted to the
sculptor represents all that Butler then knew about Tabachetti,
but since it was written various documents have come to light,
principally owing to the investigations of Cavaliere Francesco
Negri, of Casale Monferrato, which negative some of
Butler&rsquo;s most cherished conclusions.&nbsp; Had Butler lived
he would either have rewritten his essay in accordance with
Cavaliere Negri&rsquo;s discoveries, of which he fully recognised
the value, or incorporated them into the revised edition of
&ldquo;Ex Voto,&rdquo; which he intended to publish.&nbsp; As it
stands, the essay requires so much revision that I have decided
to omit it altogether, and to postpone giving English readers a
full account of Tabachetti&rsquo;s career until a second edition
of &ldquo;Ex Voto&rdquo; is required.&nbsp; Meanwhile I have
given a brief summary of the main facts of Tabachetti&rsquo;s
life in a note (page 154) to the essay on &ldquo;Art in the
Valley of Saas.&rdquo;&nbsp; Any one who wishes for further
details of the sculptor and his work will find them in Cavaliere
Negri&rsquo;s pamphlet, &ldquo;Il Santuario di Crea&rdquo;
(Alessandria, 1902).</p>
<p>The three essays grouped together under the title of
&ldquo;The Deadlock in Darwinism&rdquo; may be regarded as a
postscript to Butler&rsquo;s four books on evolution, viz.,
&ldquo;Life and Habit,&rdquo; &ldquo;Evolution, Old and
New,&rdquo; &ldquo;Unconscious Memory&rdquo; and &ldquo;Luck or
Cunning.&rdquo;&nbsp; An occasion for the publication of these
essays seemed to be afforded by the appearance in 1889 of Mr.
Alfred Russel Wallace&rsquo;s &ldquo;Darwinism&rdquo;; and
although nearly fourteen years have elapsed since they were
published in the <i>Universal Review</i>, I have no fear that
they will be found to be out of date.&nbsp; How far, indeed, the
problem embodied in the deadlock of which Butler speaks is from
solution was conclusively shown by the correspondence which
appeared in the <i>Times</i> in May 1903, occasioned by some
remarks made at University College by Lord Kelvin in moving a
vote of thanks to Professor Henslow after his lecture on
&ldquo;Present Day Rationalism.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lord Kelvin&rsquo;s
claim for a recognition of the fact that in organic nature
scientific thought is compelled to accept the idea of some kind
of directive power, and his statement that biologists are coming
once more to a firm acceptance of a vital principle, drew from
several distinguished men of science retorts heated enough to
prove beyond a doubt that the gulf between the two main divisions
of evolutionists is as wide to-day as it was when Butler
wrote.&nbsp; It will be well, perhaps, for the benefit of readers
who have not followed the history of the theory of evolution
during its later developments, to state in a few words what these
two main divisions are.&nbsp; All evolutionists agree that the
differences between species are caused by the accumulation and
transmission of variations, but they do not agree as to the
causes to which the variations are due.&nbsp; The view held by
the older evolutionists, Buffon, Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck, who
have been followed by many modern thinkers, including Herbert
Spencer and Butler, is that the variations occur mainly as the
result of effort and design; the opposite view, which is that
advocated by Mr. Wallace in &ldquo;Darwinism,&rdquo; is that the
variations occur merely as the result of chance.&nbsp; The former
is sometimes called the theological view, because it recognises
the presence in organic nature of design, whether it be called
creative power, directive force, directivity, or vital principle;
the latter view, in which the existence of design is absolutely
negatived, is now usually described as Weismannism, from the name
of the writer who has been its principal advocate in recent
years.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I must thank my friend Mr. Henry Festing Jones
most warmly for the invaluable assistance which he has given me
in preparing these essays for publication, in correcting the
proofs, and in compiling the introduction and notes.</p>

<h2>QUIS DESIDERIO . . . ? <a name="citation1"></a><a
href="#footnote1" class="citation">[1]</a></h2>
<p>Like Mr. Wilkie Collins, I, too, have been asked to lay some
of my literary experiences before the readers of the <i>Universal
Review</i>.&nbsp; It occurred to me that the <i>Review</i> must
be indeed universal before it could open its pages to one so
obscure as myself; but, nothing daunted by the distinguished
company among which I was for the first time asked to move, I
resolved to do as I was told, and went to the British Museum to
see what books I had written.&nbsp; Having refreshed my memory by
a glance at the catalogue, I was about to try and diminish the
large and ever-increasing circle of my non-readers when I became
aware of a calamity that brought me to a standstill, and indeed
bids fair, so far as I can see at present, to put an end to my
literary existence altogether.</p>
<p>I should explain that I cannot write unless I have a sloping
desk, and the reading-room of the British Museum, where alone I
can compose freely, is unprovided with sloping desks.&nbsp; Like
every other organism, if I cannot get exactly what I want I make
shift with the next thing to it; true, there are no desks in the
reading-room, but, as I once heard a visitor from the country
say, &ldquo;it contains a large number of very interesting
works.&rdquo;&nbsp; I know it was not right, and hope the Museum
authorities will not be severe upon me if any of them reads this
confession; but I wanted a desk, and set myself to consider which
of the many very interesting works which a grateful nation places
at the disposal of its would-be authors was best suited for my
purpose.</p>
<p>For mere reading I suppose one book is pretty much as good as
another; but the choice of a desk-book is a more serious
matter.&nbsp; It must be neither too thick nor too thin; it must
be large enough to make a substantial support; it must be
strongly bound so as not to yield or give; it must not be too
troublesome to carry backwards and forwards; and it must live on
shelf C, D, or E, so that there need be no stooping or reaching
too high.&nbsp; These are the conditions which a really good book
must fulfil; simple, however, as they are, it is surprising how
few volumes comply with them satisfactorily; moreover, being
perhaps too sensitively conscientious, I allowed another
consideration to influence me, and was sincerely anxious not to
take a book which would be in constant use for reference by
readers, more especially as, if I did this, I might find myself
disturbed by the officials.</p>
<p>For weeks I made experiments upon sundry poetical and
philosophical works, whose names I have forgotten, but could not
succeed in finding my ideal desk, until at length, more by luck
than cunning, I happened to light upon Frost&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lives
of Eminent Christians,&rdquo; which I had no sooner tried than I
discovered it to be the very perfection and <i>ne plus ultra</i>
of everything that a book should be.&nbsp; It lived in Case No.
2008, and I accordingly took at once to sitting in Row B, where
for the last dozen years or so I have sat ever since.</p>
<p>The first thing I have done whenever I went to the Museum has
been to take down Frost&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lives of Eminent
Christians&rdquo; and carry it to my seat.&nbsp; It is not the
custom of modern writers to refer to the works to which they are
most deeply indebted, and I have never, that I remember,
mentioned it by name before; but it is to this book alone that I
have looked for support during many years of literary labour, and
it is round this to me invaluable volume that all my own have
page by page grown up.&nbsp; There is none in the Museum to which
I have been under anything like such constant obligation, none
which I can so ill spare, and none which I would choose so
readily if I were allowed to select one single volume and keep it
for my own.</p>
<p>On finding myself asked for a contribution to the <i>Universal
Review</i>, I went, as I have explained, to the Museum, and
presently repaired to bookcase No. 2008 to get my favourite
volume.&nbsp; Alas! it was in the room no longer.&nbsp; It was
not in use, for its place was filled up already; besides, no one
ever used it but myself.&nbsp; Whether the ghost of the late Mr.
Frost has been so eminently unchristian as to interfere, or
whether the authorities have removed the book in ignorance of the
steady demand which there has been for it on the part of at least
one reader, are points I cannot determine.&nbsp; All I know is
that the book is gone, and I feel as Wordsworth is generally
supposed to have felt when he became aware that Lucy was in her
grave, and exclaimed so emphatically that this would make a
considerable difference to him, or words to that effect.</p>
<p>Now I think of it, Frost&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lives of Eminent
Christians&rdquo; was very like Lucy.&nbsp; The one resided at
Dovedale in Derbyshire, the other in Great Russell Street,
Bloomsbury.&nbsp; I admit that I do not see the resemblance here
at this moment, but if I try to develop my perception I shall
doubtless ere long find a marvellously striking one.&nbsp; In
other respects, however, than mere local habitat the likeness is
obvious.&nbsp; Lucy was not particularly attractive either inside
or out&mdash;no more was Frost&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lives of Eminent
Christians&rdquo;; there were few to praise her, and of those few
still fewer could bring themselves to like her; indeed,
Wordsworth himself seems to have been the only person who thought
much about her one way or the other.&nbsp; In like manner, I
believe I was the only reader who thought much one way or the
other about Frost&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lives of Eminent
Christians,&rdquo; but this in itself was one of the attractions
of the book; and as for the grief we respectively felt and feel,
I believe my own to be as deep as Wordsworth&rsquo;s, if not more
so.</p>
<p>I said above, &ldquo;as Wordsworth is generally supposed to
have felt&rdquo;; for any one imbued with the spirit of modern
science will read Wordsworth&rsquo;s poem with different eyes
from those of a mere literary critic.&nbsp; He will note that
Wordsworth is most careful not to explain the nature of the
difference which the death of Lucy will occasion to him.&nbsp; He
tells us that there will be a difference; but there the matter
ends.&nbsp; The superficial reader takes it that he was very
sorry she was dead; it is, of course, possible that he may have
actually been so, but he has not said this.&nbsp; On the
contrary, he has hinted plainly that she was ugly, and generally
disliked; she was only like a violet when she was half-hidden
from the view, and only fair as a star when there were so few
stars out that it was practically impossible to make an invidious
comparison.&nbsp; If there were as many as even two stars the
likeness was felt to be at an end.&nbsp; If Wordsworth had
imprudently promised to marry this young person during a time
when he had been unusually long in keeping to good resolutions,
and had afterwards seen some one whom he liked better, then
Lucy&rsquo;s death would undoubtedly have made a considerable
difference to him, and this is all that he has ever said that it
would do.&nbsp; What right have we to put glosses upon the
masterly reticence of a poet, and credit him with feelings
possibly the very reverse of those he actually entertained?</p>
<p>Sometimes, indeed, I have been inclined to think that a
mystery is being hinted at more dark than any critic has
suspected.&nbsp; I do not happen to possess a copy of the poem,
but the writer, if I am not mistaken, says that &ldquo;few could
know when Lucy ceased to be.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ceased to
be&rdquo; is a suspiciously euphemistic expression, and the words
&ldquo;few could know&rdquo; are not applicable to the ordinary
peaceful death of a domestic servant such as Lucy appears to have
been.&nbsp; No matter how obscure the deceased, any number of
people commonly can know the day and hour of his or her demise,
whereas in this case we are expressly told it would be impossible
for them to do so.&nbsp; Wordsworth was nothing if not accurate,
and would not have said that few could know, but that few
actually did know, unless he was aware of circumstances that
precluded all but those implicated in the crime of her death from
knowing the precise moment of its occurrence.&nbsp; If Lucy was
the kind of person not obscurely pourtrayed in the poem; if
Wordsworth had murdered her, either by cutting her throat or
smothering her, in concert, perhaps, with his friends Southey and
Coleridge; and if he had thus found himself released from an
engagement which had become irksome to him, or possibly from the
threat of an action for breach of promise, then there is not a
syllable in the poem with which he crowns his crime that is not
alive with meaning.&nbsp; On any other supposition to the general
reader it is unintelligible.</p>
<p>We cannot be too guarded in the interpretations we put upon
the words of great poets.&nbsp; Take the young lady who never
loved the dear gazelle&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t believe she did;
we are apt to think that Moore intended us to see in this
creation of his fancy a sweet, amiable, but most unfortunate
young woman, whereas all he has told us about her points to an
exactly opposite conclusion.&nbsp; In reality, he wished us to
see a young lady who had been an habitual complainer from her
earliest childhood; whose plants had always died as soon as she
bought them, while those belonging to her neighbours had
flourished.&nbsp; The inference is obvious, nor can we reasonably
doubt that Moore intended us to draw it; if her plants were the
very first to fade away, she was evidently the very first to
neglect or otherwise maltreat them.&nbsp; She did not give them
enough water, or left the door of her fern-ease open when she was
cooking her dinner at the gas stove, or kept them too near the
paraffin oil, or other like folly; and as for her temper, see
what the gazelles did; as long as they did not know her
&ldquo;well,&rdquo; they could just manage to exist, but when
they got to understand her real character, one after another felt
that death was the only course open to it, and accordingly died
rather than live with such a mistress.&nbsp; True, the young lady
herself said the gazelles loved her; but disagreeable people are
apt to think themselves amiable, and in view of the course
invariably taken by the gazelles themselves any one accustomed to
weigh evidence will hold that she was probably mistaken.</p>
<p>I must, however, return to Frost&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lives of
Eminent Christians.&rdquo;&nbsp; I will leave none of the
ambiguity about my words in which Moore and Wordsworth seem to
have delighted.&nbsp; I am very sorry the book is gone, and know
not where to turn for its successor.&nbsp; Till I have found a
substitute I can write no more, and I do not know how to find
even a tolerable one.&nbsp; I should try a volume of
Migne&rsquo;s &ldquo;Complete Course of Patrology,&rdquo; but I
do not like books in more than one volume, for the volumes vary
in thickness, and one never can remember which one took; the four
volumes, however, of Bede in Giles&rsquo;s &ldquo;Anglican
Fathers&rdquo; are not open to this objection, and I have
reserved them for favourable consideration.&nbsp; Mather&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Magnalia&rdquo; might do, but the binding does not please
me; Cureton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Corpus Ignatianum&rdquo; might also do
if it were not too thin.&nbsp; I do not like taking
Norton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Genuineness of the Gospels,&rdquo; as it is
just possible some one may be wanting to know whether the Gospels
are genuine or not, and be unable to find out because I have got
Mr. Norton&rsquo;s book.&nbsp; Baxter&rsquo;s &ldquo;Church
History of England,&rdquo; Lingard&rsquo;s &ldquo;Anglo-Saxon
Church,&rdquo; and Cardwell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Documentary
Annals,&rdquo; though none of them as good as Frost, are works of
considerable merit; but on the whole I think Arvine&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Cyclopedia of Moral and Religious Anecdote&rdquo; is
perhaps the one book in the room which comes within measurable
distance of Frost.&nbsp; I should probably try this book first,
but it has a fatal objection in its too seductive title.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am not curious,&rdquo; as Miss Lottie Venne says in one
of her parts, &ldquo;but I like to know,&rdquo; and I might be
tempted to pervert the book from its natural uses and open it, so
as to find out what kind of a thing a moral and religious
anecdote is.&nbsp; I know, of course, that there are a great many
anecdotes in the Bible, but no one thinks of calling them either
moral or religious, though some of them certainly seem as if they
might fairly find a place in Mr. Arvine&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; There
are some things, however, which it is better not to know, and
take it all round I do not think I should be wise in putting
myself in the way of temptation, and adopting Arvine as the
successor to my beloved and lamented Frost.</p>
<p>Some successor I must find, or I must give up writing
altogether, and this I should be sorry to do.&nbsp; I have only
as yet written about a third, or from that&mdash;counting works
written but not published&mdash;to a half, of the books which I
have set myself to write.&nbsp; It would not so much matter if
old age was not staring me in the face.&nbsp; Dr. Parr said it
was &ldquo;a beastly shame for an old man not to have laid down a
good cellar of port in his youth&rdquo;; I, like the greater
number, I suppose, of those who write books at all, write in
order that I may have something to read in my old age when I can
write no longer.&nbsp; I know what I shall like better than any
one can tell me, and write accordingly; if my career is nipped in
the bud, as seems only too likely, I really do not know where
else I can turn for present agreeable occupation, nor yet how to
make suitable provision for my later years.&nbsp; Other writers
can, of course, make excellent provision for their own old ages,
but they cannot do so for mine, any more than I should succeed if
I were to try to cater for theirs.&nbsp; It is one of those cases
in which no man can make agreement for his brother.</p>
<p>I have no heart for continuing this article, and if I had, I
have nothing of interest to say.&nbsp; No one&rsquo;s literary
career can have been smoother or more unchequered than
mine.&nbsp; I have published all my books at my own expense, and
paid for them in due course.&nbsp; What can be conceivably more
unromantic?&nbsp; For some years I had a little literary
grievance against the authorities of the British Museum because
they would insist on saying in their catalogue that I had
published three sermons on Infidelity in the year 1820.&nbsp; I
thought I had not, and got them out to see.&nbsp; They were
rather funny, but they were not mine.&nbsp; Now, however, this
grievance has been removed.&nbsp; I had another little quarrel
with them because they would describe me as &ldquo;of St.
John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge,&rdquo; an establishment for
which I have the most profound veneration, but with which I have
not had the honour to be connected for some quarter of a
century.&nbsp; At last they said they would change this
description if I would only tell them what I was, for, though
they had done their best to find out, they had themselves
failed.&nbsp; I replied with modest pride that I was a Bachelor
of Arts.&nbsp; I keep all my other letters inside my name, not
outside.&nbsp; They mused and said it was unfortunate that I was
not a Master of Arts.&nbsp; Could I not get myself made a
Master?&nbsp; I said I understood that a Mastership was an
article the University could not do under about five pounds, and
that I was not disposed to go sixpence higher than three
ten.&nbsp; They again said it was a pity, for it would be very
inconvenient to them if I did not keep to something between a
bishop and a poet.&nbsp; I might be anything I liked in reason,
provided I showed proper respect for the alphabet; but they had
got me between &ldquo;Samuel Butler, bishop,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Samuel Butler, poet.&rdquo;&nbsp; It would be very
troublesome to shift me, and bachelor came before bishop.&nbsp;
This was reasonable, so I replied that, under those
circumstances, if they pleased, I thought I would like to be a
philosophical writer.&nbsp; They embraced the solution, and, no
matter what I write now, I must remain a philosophical writer as
long as I live, for the alphabet will hardly be altered in my
time, and I must be something between &ldquo;Bis&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Poe.&rdquo;&nbsp; If I could get a volume of my excellent
namesake&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hudibras&rdquo; out of the list of my
works, I should be robbed of my last shred of literary grievance,
so I say nothing about this, but keep it secret, lest some worse
thing should happen to me.&nbsp; Besides, I have a great respect
for my namesake, and always say that if &ldquo;Erewhon&rdquo; had
been a racehorse it would have been got by &ldquo;Hudibras&rdquo;
out of &ldquo;Analogy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some one said this to me many
years ago, and I felt so much flattered that I have been
repeating the remark as my own ever since.</p>
<p>But how small are these grievances as compared with those
endured without a murmur by hundreds of writers far more
deserving than myself.&nbsp; When I see the scores and hundreds
of workers in the reading-room who have done so much more than I
have, but whose work is absolutely fruitless to themselves, and
when I think of the prompt recognition obtained by my own work, I
ask myself what I have done to be thus rewarded.&nbsp; On the
other hand, the feeling that I have succeeded far beyond my
deserts hitherto, makes it all the harder for me to acquiesce
without complaint in the extinction of a career which I honestly
believe to be a promising one; and once more I repeat that,
unless the Museum authorities give me back my Frost, or put a
locked clasp on Arvine, my career must be extinguished.&nbsp;
Give me back Frost, and, if life and health are spared, I will
write another dozen of volumes yet before I hang up my
fiddle&mdash;if so serious a confusion of metaphors may be
pardoned.&nbsp; I know from long experience how kind and
considerate both the late and present superintendents of the
reading-room were and are, but I doubt how far either of them
would be disposed to help me on this occasion; continue, however,
to rob me of my Frost, and, whatever else I may do, I will write
no more books.</p>
<p><i>Note by Dr. Garnett</i>, <i>British Museum</i>.&mdash;The
frost has broken up.&nbsp; Mr. Butler is restored to
literature.&nbsp; Mr. Mudie may make himself easy.&nbsp; England
will still boast a humourist; and the late Mr. Darwin (to whose
posthumous machinations the removal of the book was owing) will
continue to be confounded.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R.

<h2>RAMBLINGS IN CHEAPSIDE <a name="citation2"></a><a
href="#footnote2" class="citation">[2]</a></h2>
<p>Walking the other day in Cheapside I saw some turtles in Mr.
Sweeting&rsquo;s window, and was tempted to stay and look at
them.&nbsp; As I did so I was struck not more by the defences
with which they were hedged about, than by the fatuousness of
trying to hedge that in at all which, if hedged thoroughly, must
die of its own defencefulness.&nbsp; The holes for the head and
feet through which the turtle leaks out, as it were, on to the
exterior world, and through which it again absorbs the exterior
world into itself&mdash;&ldquo;catching on&rdquo; through them to
things that are thus both turtle and not turtle at one and the
same time&mdash;these holes stultify the armour, and show it to
have been designed by a creature with more of faithfulness to a
fixed idea, and hence one-sidedness, than of that quick sense of
relative importances and their changes, which is the main factor
of good living.</p>
<p>The turtle obviously had no sense of proportion; it differed
so widely from myself that I could not comprehend it; and as this
word occurred to me, it occurred also that until my body
comprehended its body in a physical material sense, neither would
my mind be able to comprehend its mind with any
thoroughness.&nbsp; For unity of mind can only be consummated by
unity of body; everything, therefore, must be in some respects
both knave and fool to all that which has not eaten it, or by
which it has not been eaten.&nbsp; As long as the turtle was in
the window and I in the street outside, there was no chance of
our comprehending one another.</p>
<p>Nevertheless I knew that I could get it to agree with me if I
could so effectually button-hole and fasten on to it as to eat
it.&nbsp; Most men have an easy method with turtle soup, and I
had no misgiving but that if I could bring my first premise to
bear I should prove the better reasoner.&nbsp; My difficulty lay
in this initial process, for I had not with me the argument that
would alone compel Mr. Sweeting think that I ought to be allowed
to convert the turtles&mdash;I mean I had no money in my
pocket.&nbsp; No missionary enterprise can be carried on without
any money at all, but even so small a sum as half-a-crown would,
I suppose, have enabled me to bring the turtle partly round, and
with many half-crowns I could in time no doubt convert the lot,
for the turtle needs must go where the money drives.&nbsp; If, as
is alleged, the world stands on a turtle, the turtle stands on
money.&nbsp; No money no turtle.&nbsp; As for money, that stands
on opinion, credit, trust, faith&mdash;things that, though highly
material in connection with money, are still of immaterial
essence.</p>
<p>The steps are perfectly plain.&nbsp; The men who caught the
turtles brought a fairly strong and definite opinion to bear upon
them, that passed into action, and later on into money.&nbsp;
They thought the turtles would come that way, and verified their
opinion; on this, will and action were generated, with the result
that the men turned the turtles on their backs and carried them
off.&nbsp; Mr. Sweeting touched these men with money, which is
the outward and visible sign of verified opinion.&nbsp; The
customer touches Mr. Sweeting with money, Mr. Sweeting touches
the waiter and the cook with money.&nbsp; They touch the turtle
with skill and verified opinion.&nbsp; Finally, the customer
applies the clinching argument that brushes all sophisms aside,
and bids the turtle stand protoplasm to protoplasm with himself,
to know even as it is known.</p>
<p>But it must be all touch, touch, touch; skill, opinion, power,
and money, passing in and out with one another in any order we
like, but still link to link and touch to touch.&nbsp; If there
is failure anywhere in respect of opinion, skill, power, or
money, either as regards quantity or quality, the chain can be no
stronger than its weakest link, and the turtle and the clinching
argument will fly asunder.&nbsp; Of course, if there is an
initial failure in connection, through defect in any member of
the chain, or of connection between the links, it will no more be
attempted to bring the turtle and the clinching argument
together, than it will to chain up a dog with two pieces of
broken chain that are disconnected.&nbsp; The contact throughout
must be conceived as absolute; and yet perfect contact is
inconceivable by us, for on becoming perfect it ceases to be
contact, and becomes essential, once for all inseverable,
identity.&nbsp; The most absolute contact short of this is still
contact by courtesy only.&nbsp; So here, as everywhere else,
Eurydice glides off as we are about to grasp her.&nbsp; We can
see nothing face to face; our utmost seeing is but a fumbling of
blind finger-ends in an overcrowded pocket.</p>
<p>Presently my own blind finger-ends fished up the conclusion,
that as I had neither time nor money to spend on perfecting the
chain that would put me in full spiritual contact with Mr.
Sweeting&rsquo;s turtles, I had better leave them to complete
their education at some one else&rsquo;s expense rather than
mine, so I walked on towards the Bank.&nbsp; As I did so it
struck me how continually we are met by this melting of one
existence into another.&nbsp; The limits of the body seem well
defined enough as definitions go, but definitions seldom go
far.&nbsp; What, for example, can seem more distinct from a man
than his banker or his solicitor?&nbsp; Yet these are commonly so
much parts of him that he can no more cut them off and grow new
ones, than he can grow new legs or arms; neither must he wound
his solicitor; a wound in the solicitor is a very serious
thing.&nbsp; As for his bank&mdash;failure of his bank&rsquo;s
action may be as fatal to a man as failure of his heart.&nbsp; I
have said nothing about the medical or spiritual adviser, but
most men grow into the society that surrounds them by the help of
these four main tap-roots, and not only into the world of
humanity, but into the universe at large.&nbsp; We can, indeed,
grow butchers, bakers, and greengrocers, almost <i>ad
libitum</i>, but these are low developments, and correspond to
skin, hair, or finger-nails.&nbsp; Those of us again who are not
highly enough organised to have grown a solicitor or banker can
generally repair the loss of whatever social organisation they
may possess as freely as lizards are said to grow new tails; but
this with the higher social, as well as organic, developments is
only possible to a very limited extent.</p>
<p>The doctrine of metempsychosis, or transmigration of
souls&mdash;a doctrine to which the foregoing considerations are
for the most part easy corollaries&mdash;crops up no matter in
what direction we allow our thoughts to wander.&nbsp; And we meet
instances of transmigration of body as well as of soul.&nbsp; I
do not mean that both body and soul have transmigrated together,
far from it; but that, as we can often recognise a transmigrated
mind in an alien body, so we not less often see a body that is
clearly only a transmigration, linked on to some one else&rsquo;s
new and alien soul.&nbsp; We meet people every day whose bodies
are evidently those of men and women long dead, but whose
appearance we know through their portraits.&nbsp; We see them
going about in omnibuses, railway carriages, and in all public
places.&nbsp; The cards have been shuffled, and they have drawn
fresh lots in life and nationalities, but any one fairly well up
in medi&aelig;val and last century portraiture knows them at a
glance.</p>
<p>Going down once towards Italy I saw a young man in the train
whom I recognised, only he seemed to have got younger.&nbsp; He
was with a friend, and his face was in continual play, but for
some little time I puzzled in vain to recollect where it was that
I had seen him before.&nbsp; All of a sudden I remembered he was
King Francis I. of France.&nbsp; I had hitherto thought the face
of this king impossible, but when I saw it in play I understood
it.&nbsp; His great contemporary Henry VIII. keeps a restaurant
in Oxford Street.&nbsp; Falstaff drove one of the St. Gothard
diligences for many years, and only retired when the railway was
opened.&nbsp; Titian once made me a pair of boots at Vicenza, and
not very good ones.&nbsp; At Modena I had my hair cut by a young
man whom I perceived to be Raffaelle.&nbsp; The model who sat to
him for his celebrated Madonnas is first lady in a confectionery
establishment at Montreal.&nbsp; She has a little motherly pimple
on the left side of her nose that is misleading at first, but on
examination she is readily recognised; probably Raffaelle&rsquo;s
model had the pimple too, but Raffaelle left it out&mdash;as he
would.</p>
<p>Handel, of course, is Madame Patey.&nbsp; Give Madame Patey
Handel&rsquo;s wig and clothes, and there would be no telling her
from Handel.&nbsp; It is not only that the features and the shape
of the head are the same, but there is a certain imperiousness of
expression and attitude about Handel which he hardly attempts to
conceal in Madame Patey.&nbsp; It is a curious coincidence that
he should continue to be such an incomparable renderer of his own
music.&nbsp; Pope Julius II. was the late Mr. Darwin.&nbsp;
Rameses II. is a blind woman now, and stands in Holborn, holding
a tin mug.&nbsp; I never could understand why I always found
myself humming &ldquo;They oppressed them with burthens&rdquo;
when I passed her, till one day I was looking in Mr.
Spooner&rsquo;s window in the Strand, and saw a photograph of
Rameses II.&nbsp; Mary Queen of Scots wears surgical boots and is
subject to fits, near the Horse Shoe in Tottenham Court Road.</p>
<p>Michael Angelo is a commissionaire; I saw him on board the
<i>Glen Rosa</i>, which used to run every day from London to
Clacton-on-Sea and back.&nbsp; It gave me quite a turn when I saw
him coming down the stairs from the upper deck, with his bronzed
face, flattened nose, and with the familiar bar upon his
forehead.&nbsp; I never liked Michael Angelo, and never shall,
but I am afraid of him, and was near trying to hide when I saw
him coming towards me.&nbsp; He had not got his
commissionaire&rsquo;s uniform on, and I did not know he was one
till I met him a month or so later in the Strand.&nbsp; When we
got to Blackwall the music struck up and people began to
dance.&nbsp; I never saw a man dance so much in my life.&nbsp; He
did not miss a dance all the way to Clacton, nor all the way back
again, and when not dancing he was flirting and cracking
jokes.&nbsp; I could hardly believe my eyes when I reflected that
this man had painted the famous &ldquo;Last Judgment,&rdquo; and
had made all those statues.</p>
<p>Dante is, or was a year or two ago, a waiter at Brissago on
the Lago Maggiore, only he is better-tempered-looking, and has a
more intellectual expression.&nbsp; He gave me his ideas upon
beauty: &ldquo;Tutto ch&rsquo; &egrave; vero &egrave;
bello,&rdquo; he exclaimed, with all his old
self-confidence.&nbsp; I am not afraid of Dante.&nbsp; I know
people by their friends, and he went about with Virgil, so I said
with some severity, &ldquo;No, Dante, il naso della Signora
Robinson &egrave; vero, ma non &egrave; bello&rdquo;; and he
admitted I was right.&nbsp; Beatrice&rsquo;s name is Towler; she
is waitress at a small inn in German Switzerland.&nbsp; I used to
sit at my window and hear people call &ldquo;Towler, Towler,
Towler,&rdquo; fifty times in a forenoon.&nbsp; She was the exact
antithesis to Abra; Abra, if I remember, used to come before they
called her name, but no matter how often they called Towler,
every one came before she did.&nbsp; I suppose they spelt her
name Taula, but to me it sounded Towler; I never, however, met
any one else with this name.&nbsp; She was a sweet, artless
little hussy, who made me play the piano to her, and she said it
was lovely.&nbsp; Of course I only played my own compositions; so
I believed her, and it all went off very nicely.&nbsp; I thought
it might save trouble if I did not tell her who she really was,
so I said nothing about it.</p>
<p>I met Socrates once.&nbsp; He was my muleteer on an excursion
which I will not name, for fear it should identify the man.&nbsp;
The moment I saw my guide I knew he was somebody, but for the
life of me I could not remember who.&nbsp; All of a sudden it
flashed across me that he was Socrates.&nbsp; He talked enough
for six, but it was all in <i>dialetto</i>, so I could not
understand him, nor, when I had discovered who he was, did I much
try to do so.&nbsp; He was a good creature, a trifle given to
stealing fruit and vegetables, but an amiable man enough.&nbsp;
He had had a long day with his mule and me, and he only asked me
five francs.&nbsp; I gave him ten, for I pitied his poor old
patched boots, and there was a meekness about him that touched
me.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now, Socrates,&rdquo; said I at parting,
&ldquo;we go on our several ways, you to steal tomatoes, I to
filch ideas from other people; for the rest&mdash;which of these
two roads will be the better going, our father which is in heaven
knows, but we know not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have never seen Mendelssohn, but there is a fresco of him on
the terrace, or open-air dining-room, of an inn at
Chiavenna.&nbsp; He is not called Mendelssohn, but I knew him by
his legs.&nbsp; He is in the costume of a dandy of some
five-and-forty years ago, is smoking a cigar, and appears to be
making an offer of marriage to his cook.&nbsp; Beethoven both my
friend Mr. H. Festing Jones and I have had the good fortune to
meet; he is an engineer now, and does not know one note from
another; he has quite lost his deafness, is married, and is, of
course, a little squat man with the same refractory hair that he
always had.&nbsp; It was very interesting to watch him, and Jones
remarked that before the end of dinner he had become positively
posthumous.&nbsp; One morning I was told the Beethovens were
going away, and before long I met their two heavy boxes being
carried down the stairs.&nbsp; The boxes were so squab and like
their owners, that I half thought for a moment that they were
inside, and should hardly have been surprised to see them spring
up like a couple of Jacks-in-the-box.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sono
indentro?&rdquo; said I, with a frown of wonder, pointing to the
boxes.&nbsp; The porters knew what I meant, and laughed.&nbsp;
But there is no end to the list of people whom I have been able
to recognise, and before I had got through it myself, I found I
had walked some distance, and had involuntarily paused in front
of a second-hand bookstall.</p>
<p>I do not like books.&nbsp; I believe I have the smallest
library of any literary man in London, and I have no wish to
increase it.&nbsp; I keep my books at the British Museum and at
Mudie&rsquo;s, and it makes me very angry if any one gives me one
for my private library.&nbsp; I once heard two ladies disputing
in a railway carriage as to whether one of them had or had not
been wasting money.&nbsp; &ldquo;I spent it in books,&rdquo; said
the accused, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s not wasting money to buy
books.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Indeed, my dear, I think it is,&rdquo;
was the rejoinder, and in practice I agree with it.&nbsp;
Webster&rsquo;s Dictionary, Whitaker&rsquo;s Almanack, and
Bradshaw&rsquo;s Railway Guide should be sufficient for any
ordinary library; it will be time enough to go beyond these when
the mass of useful and entertaining matter which they provide has
been mastered.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I admit that sometimes, if not
particularly busy, I stop at a second-hand bookstall and turn
over a book or two from mere force of habit.</p>
<p>I know not what made me pick up a copy of
&AElig;schylus&mdash;of course in an English version&mdash;or
rather I know not what made &AElig;schylus take up with me, for
he took me rather than I him; but no sooner had he got me than he
began puzzling me, as he has done any time this forty years, to
know wherein his transcendent merit can be supposed to lie.&nbsp;
To me he is, like the greater number of classics in all ages and
countries, a literary Struldbrug, rather than a true ambrosia-fed
immortal.&nbsp; There are true immortals, but they are few and
far between; most classics are as great impostors dead as they
were when living, and while posing as gods are, five-sevenths of
them, only Struldbrugs.&nbsp; It comforts me to remember that
Aristophanes liked &AElig;schylus no better than I do.&nbsp;
True, he praises him by comparison with Sophocles and Euripides,
but he only does so that he may run down these last more
effectively.&nbsp; Aristophanes is a safe man to follow, nor do I
see why it should not be as correct to laugh with him as to pull
a long face with the Greek Professors; but this is neither here
nor there, for no one really cares about &AElig;schylus; the more
interesting question is how he contrived to make so many people
for so many years pretend to care about him.</p>
<p>Perhaps he married somebody&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; If a man
would get hold of the public ear, he must pay, marry, or
fight.&nbsp; I have never understood that &AElig;schylus was a
man of means, and the fighters do not write poetry, so I suppose
he must have married a theatrical manager&rsquo;s daughter, and
got his plays brought out that way.&nbsp; The ear of any age or
country is like its land, air, and water; it seems limitless but
is really limited, and is already in the keeping of those who
naturally enough will have no squatting on such valuable
property.&nbsp; It is written and talked up to as closely as the
means of subsistence are bred up to by a teeming
population.&nbsp; There is not a square inch of it but is in
private hands, and he who would freehold any part of it must do
so by purchase, marriage, or fighting, in the usual way&mdash;and
fighting gives the longest, safest tenure.&nbsp; The public
itself has hardly more voice in the question who shall have its
ear, than the land has in choosing its owners.&nbsp; It is farmed
as those who own it think most profitable to themselves, and
small blame to them; nevertheless, it has a residuum of
mulishness which the land has not, and does sometimes dispossess
its tenants.&nbsp; It is in this residuum that those who fight
place their hope and trust.</p>
<p>Or perhaps &AElig;schylus squared the leading critics of his
time.&nbsp; When one comes to think of it, he must have done so,
for how is it conceivable that such plays should have had such
runs if he had not?&nbsp; I met a lady one year in Switzerland
who had some parrots that always travelled with her and were the
idols of her life.&nbsp; These parrots would not let any one read
aloud in their presence, unless they heard their own names
introduced from time to time.&nbsp; If these were freely
interpolated into the text they would remain as still as stones,
for they thought the reading was about themselves.&nbsp; If it
was not about them it could not be allowed.&nbsp; The leaders of
literature are like these parrots; they do not look at what a man
writes, nor if they did would they understand it much better than
the parrots do; but they like the sound of their own names, and
if these are freely interpolated in a tone they take as friendly,
they may even give ear to an outsider.&nbsp; Otherwise they will
scream him off if they can.</p>
<p>I should not advise any one with ordinary independence of mind
to attempt the public ear unless he is confident that he can
out-lung and out-last his own generation; for if he has any
force, people will and ought to be on their guard against him,
inasmuch as there is no knowing where he may not take them.&nbsp;
Besides, they have staked their money on the wrong men so often
without suspecting it, that when there comes one whom they do
suspect it would be madness not to bet against him.&nbsp; True,
he may die before he has out-screamed his opponents, but that has
nothing to do with it.&nbsp; If his scream was well pitched it
will sound clearer when he is dead.&nbsp; We do not know what
death is.&nbsp; If we know so little about life which we have
experienced, how shall we know about death which we have
not&mdash;and in the nature of things never can?&nbsp; Every one,
as I said years ago in &ldquo;Alps and Sanctuaries,&rdquo; is an
immortal to himself, for he cannot know that he is dead until he
is dead, and when dead how can he know anything about
anything?&nbsp; All we know is, that even the humblest dead may
live long after all trace of the body has disappeared; we see
them doing it in the bodies and memories of those that come after
them; and not a few live so much longer and more effectually than
is desirable, that it has been necessary to get rid of them by
Act of Parliament.&nbsp; It is love that alone gives life, and
the truest life is that which we live not in ourselves but
vicariously in others, and with which we have no concern.&nbsp;
Our concern is so to order ourselves that we may be of the number
of them that enter into life&mdash;although we know it not.</p>
<p>&AElig;schylus did so order himself; but his life is not of
that inspiriting kind that can be won through fighting the good
fight only&mdash;or being believed to have fought it.&nbsp; His
voice is the echo of a drone, drone-begotten and
drone-sustained.&nbsp; It is not a tone that a man must utter or
die&mdash;nay, even though he die; and likely enough half the
allusions and hard passages in &AElig;schylus of which we can
make neither head nor tail are in reality only puffs of some of
the literary leaders of his time.</p>
<p>The lady above referred to told me more about her
parrots.&nbsp; She was like a Nasmyth&rsquo;s hammer going
slow&mdash;very gentle, but irresistible.&nbsp; She always read
the newspaper to them.&nbsp; What was the use of having a
newspaper if one did not read it to one&rsquo;s parrots?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have you divined,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;to which
side they incline in politics?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do not like Mr. Gladstone,&rdquo; was the somewhat
freezing answer; &ldquo;this is the only point on which we
disagree, for I adore him.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t ask more about this,
it is a great grief to me.&nbsp; I tell them everything,&rdquo;
she continued, &ldquo;and hide no secret from them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But can any parrot be trusted to keep a
secret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And on Sundays do you give them the same course of
reading as on a week-day, or do you make a difference?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Sundays I always read them a genealogical chapter
from the Old or New Testament, for I can thus introduce their
names without profanity.&nbsp; I always keep tea by me in case
they should ask for it in the night, and I have an Etna to warm
it for them; they take milk and sugar.&nbsp; The old white-headed
clergyman came to see them last night; it was very painful, for
Jocko reminded him so strongly of his late . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought she was going to say &ldquo;wife,&rdquo; but it
proved to have been only of a parrot that he had once known and
loved.</p>
<p>One evening she was in difficulties about the quarantine,
which was enforced that year on the Italian frontier.&nbsp; The
local doctor had gone down that morning to see the Italian doctor
and arrange some details.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then, perhaps, my
dear,&rdquo; she said to her husband, &ldquo;he is the
quarantine.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, my love,&rdquo; replied her
husband.&nbsp; &ldquo;The quarantine is not a person, it is a
place where they put people&rdquo;; but she would not be
comforted, and suspected the quarantine as an enemy that might at
any moment pounce out upon her and her parrots.&nbsp; So a lady
told me once that she had been in like trouble about the
anthem.&nbsp; She read in her prayer-book that in choirs and
places where they sing &ldquo;here followeth the anthem,&rdquo;
yet the person with this most mysteriously sounding name never
did follow.&nbsp; They had a choir, and no one could say the
church was not a place where they sang, for they did
sing&mdash;both chants and hymns.&nbsp; Why, then, this
persistent slackness on the part of the anthem, who at this
juncture should follow her papa, the rector, into the
reading-desk?&nbsp; No doubt he would come some day, and then
what would he be like?&nbsp; Fair or dark?&nbsp; Tall or
short?&nbsp; Would he be bald and wear spectacles like papa, or
would he be young and good-looking?&nbsp; Anyhow, there was
something wrong, for it was announced that he would follow, and
he never did follow; therefore there was no knowing what he might
not do next.</p>
<p>I heard of the parrots a year or two later as giving lessons
in Italian to an English maid.&nbsp; I do not know what their
terms were.&nbsp; Alas! since then both they and their mistress
have joined the majority.&nbsp; When the poor lady felt her end
was near she desired (and the responsibility for this must rest
with her, not me) that the birds might be destroyed, as fearing
that they might come to be neglected, and knowing that they could
never be loved again as she had loved them.&nbsp; On being told
that all was over, she said, &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; and
immediately expired.</p>
<p>Reflecting in such random fashion, and strolling with no
greater method, I worked my way back through Cheapside and found
myself once more in front of Sweeting&rsquo;s window.&nbsp; Again
the turtles attracted me.&nbsp; They were alive, and so far at
any rate they agreed with me.&nbsp; Nay, they had eyes, mouths,
legs, if not arms, and feet, so there was much in which we were
both of a mind, but surely they must be mistaken in arming
themselves so very heavily.&nbsp; Any creature on getting what
the turtle aimed at would overreach itself and be landed not in
safety but annihilation.&nbsp; It should have no communion with
the outside world at all, for death could creep in wherever the
creature could creep out; and it must creep out somewhere if it
was to hook on to outside things.&nbsp; What death can be more
absolute than such absolute isolation?&nbsp; Perfect death,
indeed, if it were attainable (which it is not), is as near
perfect security as we can reach, but it is not the kind of
security aimed at by any animal that is at the pains of defending
itself.&nbsp; For such want to have things both ways, desiring
the livingness of life without its perils, and the safety of
death without its deadness, and some of us do actually get this
for a considerable time, but we do not get it by plating
ourselves with armour as the turtle does.&nbsp; We tried this in
the Middle Ages, and no longer mock ourselves with the weight of
armour that our forefathers carried in battle.&nbsp; Indeed the
more deadly the weapons of attack become the more we go into the
fight slug-wise.</p>
<p>Slugs have ridden their contempt for defensive armour as much
to death as the turtles their pursuit of it.&nbsp; They have
hardly more than skin enough to hold themselves together; they
court death every time they cross the road.&nbsp; Yet death comes
not to them more than to the turtle, whose defences are so great
that there is little left inside to be defended.&nbsp; Moreover,
the slugs fare best in the long run, for turtles are dying out,
while slugs are not, and there must be millions of slugs all the
world over for every single turtle.&nbsp; Of the two vanities,
therefore, that of the slug seems most substantial.</p>
<p>In either case the creature thinks itself safe, but is sure to
be found out sooner or later; nor is it easy to explain this
mockery save by reflecting that everything must have its meat in
due season, and that meat can only be found for such a multitude
of mouths by giving everything as meat in due season to something
else.&nbsp; This is like the Kilkenny cats, or robbing Peter to
pay Paul; but it is the way of the world, and as every animal
must contribute in kind to the picnic of the universe, one does
not see what better arrangement could be made than the providing
each race with a hereditary fallacy, which shall in the end get
it into a scrape, but which shall generally stand the wear and
tear of life for some time.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Do ut des</i>&rdquo;
is the writing on all flesh to him that eats it; and no creature
is dearer to itself than it is to some other that would devour
it.</p>
<p>Nor is there any statement or proposition more invulnerable
than living forms are.&nbsp; Propositions prey upon and are
grounded upon one another just like living forms.&nbsp; They
support one another as plants and animals do; they are based
ultimately on credit, or faith, rather than the cash of
irrefragable conviction.&nbsp; The whole universe is carried on
on the credit system, and if the mutual confidence on which it is
based were to collapse, it must itself collapse
immediately.&nbsp; Just or unjust, it lives by faith; it is based
on vague and impalpable opinion that by some inscrutable process
passes into will and action, and is made manifest in matter and
in flesh: it is meteoric&mdash;suspended in midair; it is the
baseless fabric of a vision so vast, so vivid, and so gorgeous
that no base can seem more broad than such stupendous
baselessness, and yet any man can bring it about his ears by
being over-curious; when faith fails a system based on faith
fails also.</p>
<p>Whether the universe is really a paying concern, or whether it
is an inflated bubble that must burst sooner or later, this is
another matter.&nbsp; If people were to demand cash payment in
irrefragable certainty for everything that they have taken
hitherto as paper money on the credit of the bank of public
opinion, is there money enough behind it all to stand so great a
drain even on so great a reserve?&nbsp; Probably there is not,
but happily there can be no such panic, for even though the
cultured classes may do so, the uncultured are too dull to have
brains enough to commit such stupendous folly.&nbsp; It takes a
long course of academic training to educate a man up to the
standard which he must reach before he can entertain such
questions seriously, and by a merciful dispensation of
Providence, university training is almost as costly as it is
unprofitable.&nbsp; The majority will thus be always unable to
afford it, and will base their opinions on mother wit and current
opinion rather than on demonstration.</p>
<p>So I turned my steps homewards; I saw a good many more things
on my way home, but I was told that I was not to see more this
time than I could get into twelve pages of the <i>Universal
Review</i>; I must therefore reserve any remark which I think
might perhaps entertain the reader for another occasion.</p>
<h2>THE AUNT, THE NIECES, AND THE DOG <a name="citation3"></a><a

<p>When a thing is old, broken, and useless we throw it on the
dust-heap, but when it is sufficiently old, sufficiently broken,
and sufficiently useless we give money for it, put it into a
museum, and read papers over it which people come long distances
to hear.&nbsp; By-and-by, when the whirligig of time has brought
on another revenge, the museum itself becomes a dust-heap, and
remains so till after long ages it is re-discovered, and valued
as belonging to a neo-rubbish age&mdash;containing, perhaps,
traces of a still older paleo-rubbish civilisation.&nbsp; So when
people are old, indigent, and in all respects incapable, we hold
them in greater and greater contempt as their poverty and
impotence increase, till they reach the pitch when they are
actually at the point to die, whereon they become sublime.&nbsp;
Then we place every resource our hospitals can command at their
disposal, and show no stint in our consideration for them.</p>
<p>It is the same with all our interests.&nbsp; We care most
about extremes of importance and of unimportance; but extremes of
importance are tainted with fear, and a very imperfect fear
casteth out love.&nbsp; Extremes of unimportance cannot hurt us,
therefore we are well disposed towards them; the means may come
to do so, therefore we do not love them.&nbsp; Hence we pick a
fly out of a milk-jug and watch with pleasure over its recovery,
for we are confident that under no conceivable circumstances will
it want to borrow money from us; but we feel less sure about a
mouse, so we show it no quarter.&nbsp; The compilers of our
almanacs well know this tendency of our natures, so they tell us,
not when Noah went into the ark, nor when the temple of Jerusalem
was dedicated, but that Lindley Murray, grammarian, died January
16, 1826.&nbsp; This is not because they could not find so many
as three hundred and sixty-five events of considerable interest
since the creation of the world, but because they well know we
would rather hear of something less interesting.&nbsp; We care
most about what concerns us either very closely, or so little
that practically we have nothing whatever to do with it.</p>
<p>I once asked a young Italian, who professed to have a
considerable knowledge of English literature, which of all our
poems pleased him best.&nbsp; He replied without a moment&rsquo;s
hesitation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the
fiddle,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The cow jumped over the moon;<br />
The little dog laughed to see such sport,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the dish ran away with the spoon.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He said this was better than anything in Italian.&nbsp; They
had Dante and Tasso, and ever so many more great poets, but they
had nothing comparable to &ldquo;Hey diddle diddle,&rdquo; nor
had he been able to conceive how any one could have written
it.&nbsp; Did I know the author&rsquo;s name, and had we given
him a statue?&nbsp; On this I told him of the young lady of
Harrow who would go to church in a barrow, and plied him with
whatever rhyming nonsense I could call to mind, but it was no
use; all of these things had an element of reality that robbed
them of half their charm, whereas &ldquo;Hey diddle diddle&rdquo;
had nothing in it that could conceivably concern him.</p>
<p>So again it is with the things that gall us most.&nbsp; What
is it that rises up against us at odd times and smites us in the
face again and again for years after it has happened?&nbsp; That
we spent all the best years of our life in learning what we have
found to be a swindle, and to have been known to be a swindle by
those who took money for misleading us?&nbsp; That those on whom
we most leaned most betrayed us?&nbsp; That we have only come to
feel our strength when there is little strength left of any kind
to feel?&nbsp; These things will hardly much disturb a man of
ordinary good temper.&nbsp; But that he should have said this or
that little unkind and wanton saying; that he should have gone
away from this or that hotel and given a shilling too little to
the waiter; that his clothes were shabby at such or such a
garden-party&mdash;these things gall us as a corn will sometimes
do, though the loss of a limb way not be seriously felt.</p>
<p>I have been reminded lately of these considerations with more
than common force by reading the very voluminous correspondence
left by my grandfather, Dr. Butler, of Shrewsbury, whose memoirs
I am engaged in writing.&nbsp; I have found a large number of
interesting letters on subjects of serious import, but must
confess that it is to the hardly less numerous lighter letters
that I have been most attracted, nor do I feel sure that my
eminent namesake did not share my predilection.&nbsp; Among other
letters in my possession I have one bundle that has been kept
apart, and has evidently no connection with Dr. Butler&rsquo;s
own life.&nbsp; I cannot use these letters, therefore, for my
book, but over and above the charm of their inspired spelling, I
find them of such an extremely trivial nature that I incline to
hope the reader may derive as much amusement from them as I have
done myself, and venture to give them the publicity here which I
must refuse them in my book.&nbsp; The dates and signatures have,
with the exception of Mrs. Newton&rsquo;s, been carefully erased,
but I have collected that they were written by the two servants
of a single lady who resided at no great distance from London, to
two nieces of the said lady who lived in London itself.&nbsp; The
aunt never writes, but always gets one of the servants to do so
for her.&nbsp; She appears either as &ldquo;your aunt&rdquo; or
as &ldquo;She&rdquo;; her name is not given, but she is evidently
looked upon with a good deal of awe by all who had to do with
her.</p>
<p>The letters almost all of them relate to visits either of the
aunt to London, or of the nieces to the aunt&rsquo;s home, which,
from occasional allusions to hopping, I gather to have been in
Kent, Sussex, or Surrey.&nbsp; I have arranged them to the best
of my power, and take the following to be the earliest.&nbsp; It
has no signature, but is not in the handwriting of the servant
who styles herself Elizabeth, or Mrs. Newton.&nbsp; It
runs:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Madam</span>,&mdash;Your Aunt Wishes me to inform
you she will be glad if you will let hir know if you think of
coming To hir House thiss month or Next as she cannot have you in
September on a kount of the Hoping If you ar coming she thinkes
she had batter Go to London on the Day you com to hir House the
says you shall have everry Thing raddy for you at hir House and
Mrs. Newton to meet you and stay with you till She returnes a
gann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;if you arnot Coming thiss Summer She will be in London
before thiss Month is out and will Sleep on the Sofy As She
willnot be in London more thann two nits. and She Says she
willnot truble you on anny a kount as She Will returne the Same

<p>&ldquo;Your aunt wises to know how the silk Clocks ar madup
[how the silk cloaks are made up] with a Cape or a wood as she is
a goin to have one madeup to rideout in in hir littel shas
[chaise].</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charles is a butty and so good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr &amp; Mrs Newton ar quite wall &amp; desires to be
remembered to you.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can throw no light on the meaning of the verb to
&ldquo;beslive.&rdquo;&nbsp; Each letter in the MS. is so
admirably formed that there can be no question about the word
being as I have given it.&nbsp; Nor have I been able to discover
what is referred to by the words &ldquo;Charles is a butty and so
good.&rdquo;&nbsp; We shall presently meet with a Charles who
&ldquo;flies in the Fier,&rdquo; but that Charles appears to have
been in London, whereas this one is evidently in Kent, or
wherever the aunt lived.</p>
<p>The next letter is from Mrs. Newton</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Der Miss</span> ---, I
Receve your Letter your Aunt is vary Ill and Lowspireted I Donte
think your Aunt wood Git up all Day if My Sister Wasnot to
Persage her We all Think hir lif is two monopolous. you Wish to

<p>&ldquo;I am Happy to Say We are Both Quite Well and I am Glad
no hear you are Both Quite Well</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mrs
Newton</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems to have made the nieces propose to pay a visit to
their aunt, perhaps to try and relieve the monopoly of her
existence and cheer her up a little.&nbsp; In their letter,
doubtless, the dog motive is introduced that is so finely
developed presently by Mrs. Newton.&nbsp; I should like to have
been able to give the theme as enounced by the nieces themselves,
but their letters are not before me.&nbsp; Mrs. Newton
writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear
Girls</span>,&mdash;Your Aunt receiv your Letter your Aunt will
Be vary glad to see you as it quite a greeable if it tis to you
and Shee is Quite Willing to Eair the beds and the Rooms if you
Like to Trust to hir and the Servantes; if not I may Go up there
as you Wish.&nbsp; My Sister Sleeps in the Best Room as she
allways Did and the Coock in the garret and you Can have the
Rooms the same as you allways Did as your Aunt Donte set in the
Parlour She Continlery Sets in the Ciching. your Aunt says she
Cannot Part from the dog know hows and She Says he will not hurt
you for he is Like a Child and I can safeley say My Self he wonte
hurt you as She Cannot Sleep in the Room With out him as he
allWay Sleep in the Same Room as She Dose. your Aunt is agreeable
to Git in What Coles and Wood you Wish for I am know happy to say
your Aunt is in as Good health as ever She Was and She is happy
to hear you are Both Well your Aunt Wishes for Ancer By Return of
Post.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The nieces replied that their aunt must choose between the dog
and them, and Mrs. Newton sends a second letter which brings her
development to a climax.&nbsp; It runs:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Miss</span> ---, I
have Receve your Letter and i Whent up to your Aunt as you Wish
me and i Try to Perveal With her about the Dog But she Wold not
Put the Dog away nor it alow him to Be Tied up But She Still

never sence She has had it Donup ferfere of Spoiling the Paint
your Aunt think it vary Strange you Should Be so vary Much afraid
of a Dog and She says you Cant Go out in London But What you are
up a gance one and She says She Wonte Trust the Dog in know one

<p>&ldquo;I Still Remane your Humble Servant Mrs Newton</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am vary sorry to think the Dog Perventes your
Comeing</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Glad to hear you are Both Well and we are the
same.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The nieces remained firm, and from the following letter it is
plain the aunt gave way.&nbsp; The dog motive is repeated
<i>pianissimo</i>, and is not returned to&mdash;not at least by
Mrs. Newton.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Miss</span> ---, I
Receve your Letter on Thursday i Whent to your Aunt and i see her
and She is a Greable to everry thing i asked her and seme so vary
Much Please to see you Both Next Tuseday and she has sent for the
Faggots to Day and she Will Send for the Coles to Morrow and i
will Go up there to Morrow Morning and Make the Fiers and Tend to
the Beds and sleep in it Till you Come Down your Aunt sends her
Love to you Both and she is Quite well your Aunt Wishes you wold
Write againe Before you Come as she ma Expeckye and the Dog is
not to Gointo the Parlor a Tall</p>
<p>&ldquo;your Aunt kind Love to you Both &amp; hopes you Wonte
Fail in Coming according to Prommis</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Mrs
Newton</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From a later letter it appears that the nieces did not pay
their visit after all, and what is worse a letter had miscarried,
and the aunt sat up expecting them from seven till twelve at
night, and Harry had paid for &ldquo;Faggots and Coles quarter of
Hund.&nbsp; Faggots Half tun of Coles 1<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i>
3<i>d.</i>&rdquo;&nbsp; Shortly afterwards, however,
&ldquo;She&rdquo; again talks of coming up to London herself and
writes through her servant&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My Dear girls i Receve your kind letter
&amp; I am happy to hear you ar both Well and I Was in hopes of
seeing of you Both Down at My House this spring to stay a Wile I
am Quite well my self in Helth But vary Low Spireted I am vary
sorry to hear the Misforting of Poor charles &amp; how he cum to
flie in the Fier I cannot think.&nbsp; I should like to know if
he is dead or a Live, and I shall come to London in August &amp;
stay three or four daies if it is agreable to you.&nbsp; Mrs.
Newton has lost her mother in Law 4 day March &amp; I hope you
send me word Wather charles is Dead or a Live as soon as
possible, and will you send me word what Little Betty is for I
cannot make her out.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next letter is a new handwriting, and tells the nieces of
their aunt&rsquo;s death in the the following terms:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Miss</span> ---,
It is my most painful duty to inform you that your dear aunt
expired this morning comparatively easy as Hannah informs me and
in so doing restored her soul to the custody of him whom she
considered to be alone worthy of its care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doctor had visited her about five minutes
previously and had applied a blister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and your sister will I am sure excuse further
details at present and believe me with kindest remembrances to
remain</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours truly, &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a few days a lawyer&rsquo;s letter informs the nieces
that their aunt had left them the bulk of her not very
considerable property, but had charged them with an annuity of
&pound;1 a week to be paid to Harry and Mrs. Newton so long as
the dog lived.</p>
<p>The only other letters by Mrs. Newton are written on paper of
a different and more modern size; they leave an impression of
having been written a good many years later.&nbsp; I take them as
they come.&nbsp; The first is very short:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Miss</span> ---, i
write to say i cannot possiblely come on Wednesday as we have
killed a pig.&nbsp; your&rsquo;s truely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Elizabeth
Newton</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second runs:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Miss</span> ---, i
hope you are both quite well in health &amp; your Leg much better
i am happy to say i am getting quite well again i hope Amandy has
reached you safe by this time i sent a small parcle by Amandy,
there was half a dozen Pats of butter &amp; the Cakes was very
homely and not so light as i could wish i hope by this time Sarah
Ann has promised she will stay untill next monday as i think a
few daies longer will not make much diferance and as her young
man has been very considerate to wait so long as he has i think
he would for a few days Longer dear Miss --- I wash for William
and i have not got his clothes yet as it has been delayed by the
carrier &amp; i cannot possiblely get it done before Sunday and i
do not Like traviling on a Sunday but to oblige you i would come
but to come sooner i cannot possiblely but i hope Sarah Ann will
be prevailed on once more as She has so many times i feel sure if
she tells her young man he will have patient for he is a very
kind young man</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;i remain your sincerely<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Elizabeth Newton</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last letter in my collection seems written almost within
measurable distance of the Christmas-card era.&nbsp; The sheet is
headed by a beautifully embossed device of some holly in red and
green, wishing the recipient of the letter a merry Xmas and a
happy new year, while the border is crimped and edged with
blue.&nbsp; I know not what it is, but there is something in the
writer&rsquo;s highly finished style that reminds me of
Mendelssohn.&nbsp; It would almost do for the words of one of his
celebrated &ldquo;Lieder ohne Worte&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Miss
Maria</span>,&mdash;I hasten to acknowledge the receipt of your
kind note with the inclosure for which I return my best
thanks.&nbsp; I need scarcely say how glad I was to know that the
volumes secured your approval, and that the announcement of the
improvement in the condition of your Sister&rsquo;s legs afforded
me infinite pleasure.&nbsp; The gratifying news encouraged me in
the hope that now the nature of the disorder is comprehended her
legs will&mdash;notwithstanding the process may be
gradual&mdash;ultimately get quite well.&nbsp; The pretty Robin
Redbreast which lay ensconced in your epistle, conveyed to me, in
terms more eloquent than words, how much you desired me those
Compliments which the little missive he bore in his bill
expressed; the emblem is sweetly pretty, and now that we are
again allowed to felicitate each other on another recurrence of
the season of the Christian&rsquo;s rejoicing, permit me to
tender to yourself, and by you to your Sister, mine and my
Wife&rsquo;s heartfelt congratulations and warmest wishes with
respect to the coming year.&nbsp; It is a common belief that if
we take a retrospective view of each departing year, as it
behoves us annually to do, we shall find the blessings which we
have received to immeasurably outnumber our causes of
sorrow.&nbsp; Speaking for myself I can fully subscribe to that
sentiment, and doubtless neither Miss --- nor yourself are
exceptions.&nbsp; Miss ---&rsquo;s illness and consequent
confinement to the house has been a severe trial, but in that
trouble an opportunity was afforded you to prove a Sister&rsquo;s
devotion and she has been enabled to realise a larger (if
possible) display of sisterly affection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A happy Christmas to you both, and may the new year
prove a Cornucopia from which still greater blessings than even
those we have hitherto received, shall issue, to benefit us all
by contributing to our temporal happiness and, what is of higher
importance, conducing to our felicity hereafter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sorry to hear that you were so annoyed with mice
and rats, and if I should have an opportunity to obtain a nice
cat I will do so and send my boy to your house with it.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;I remain,<br />
&ldquo;Yours truly.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How little what is commonly called education can do after all
towards the formation of a good style, and what a delightful
volume might not be entitled &ldquo;Half Hours with the Worst
Authors.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why, the finest word I know of in the
English language was coined, not by my poor old grandfather,
whose education had left little to desire, nor by any of the
admirable scholars whom he in his turn educated, but by an old
matron who presided over one of the halls, or houses of his
school.</p>
<p>This good lady, whose name by the way was Bromfield, had a
fine high temper of her own, or thought it politic to affect
one.&nbsp; One night when the boys were particularly noisy she
burst like a hurricane into the hall, collared a youngster, and
told him he was &ldquo;the
ramp-ingest-scampingest-rackety-tackety-tow-row-roaringest boy in
the whole school.&rdquo;&nbsp; Would Mrs. Newton have been able
to set the aunt and the dog before us so vividly if she had been
more highly educated?&nbsp; Would Mrs. Bromfield have been able
to forge and hurl her thunderbolt of a word if she had been
taught how to do so, or indeed been at much pains to create it at
all?&nbsp; It came.&nbsp; It was her [Greek text].&nbsp; She did
not probably know that she had done what the greatest scholar
would have had to rack his brains over for many an hour before he
could even approach.&nbsp; Tradition says that having brought
down her boy she looked round the hall in triumph, and then after
a moment&rsquo;s lull said, &ldquo;Young gentlemen, prayers are
excused,&rdquo; and left them.</p>
<p>I have sometimes thought that, after all, the main use of a
classical education consists in the check it gives to
originality, and the way in which it prevents an inconvenient
number of people from using their own eyes.&nbsp; That we will
not be at the trouble of looking at things for ourselves if we
can get any one to tell us what we ought to see goes without
saying, and it is the business of schools and universities to
assist us in this respect.&nbsp; The theory of evolution teaches
that any power not worked at pretty high pressure will
deteriorate: originality and freedom from affectation are all
very well in their way, but we can easily have too much of them,
and it is better that none should be either original or free from
cant but those who insist on being so, no matter what hindrances
obstruct, nor what incentives are offered them to see things
through the regulation medium.</p>
<p>To insist on seeing things for oneself is to be in [Greek
text], or in plain English, an idiot; nor do I see any safer
check against general vigour and clearness of thought, with
consequent terseness of expression, than that provided by the
curricula of our universities and schools of public
instruction.&nbsp; If a young man, in spite of every effort to
fit him with blinkers, will insist on getting rid of them, he
must do so at his own risk.&nbsp; He will not be long in finding
out his mistake.&nbsp; Our public schools and universities play
the beneficent part in our social scheme that cattle do in
forests: they browse the seedlings down and prevent the growth of
all but the luckiest and sturdiest.&nbsp; Of course, if there are
too many either cattle or schools, they browse so effectually
that they find no more food, and starve till equilibrium is
restored; but it seems to be a provision of nature that there
should always be these alternate periods, during which either the
cattle or the trees are getting the best of it; and, indeed,
without such provision we should have neither the one nor the
other.&nbsp; At this moment the cattle, doubtless, are in the
ascendant, and if university extension proceeds much farther, we
shall assuredly have no more Mrs. Newtons and Mrs. Bromfields;
but whatever is is best, and, on the whole, I should propose to
let things find pretty much their own level.</p>
<p>However this may be, who can question that the treasures
hidden in many a country house contain sleeping beauties even
fairer than those that I have endeavoured to waken from long
sleep in the foregoing article?&nbsp; How many Mrs. Quicklys are
there not living in London at this present moment?&nbsp; For that
Mrs. Quickly was an invention of Shakespeare&rsquo;s I will not
believe.&nbsp; The old woman from whom he drew said every word
that he put into Mrs. Quickly&rsquo;s mouth, and a great deal
more which he did not and perhaps could not make use of.&nbsp;
This question, however, would again lead me far from my subject,
which I should mar were I to dwell upon it longer, and therefore
leave with the hope that it may give my readers absolutely no
food whatever for reflection.</p>
<h2>HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF LIFE <a name="citation4"></a><a
href="#footnote4" class="citation">[4]</a></h2>
<p>I have been asked to speak on the question how to make the
best of life, but may as well confess at once that I know nothing
about it.&nbsp; I cannot think that I have made the best of my
own life, nor is it likely that I shall make much better of what
may or may not remain to me.&nbsp; I do not even know how to make
the best of the twenty minutes that your committee has placed at
my disposal, and as for life as a whole, who ever yet made the
best of such a colossal opportunity by conscious effort and
deliberation?&nbsp; In little things no doubt deliberate and
conscious effort will help us, but we are speaking of large
issues, and such kingdoms of heaven as the making the best of
these come not by observation.</p>
<p>The question, therefore, on which I have undertaken to address
you is, as you must all know, fatuous, if it be faced
seriously.&nbsp; Life is like playing a violin solo in public and
learning the instrument as one goes on.&nbsp; One cannot make the
best of such impossibilities, and the question is doubly fatuous
until we are told which of our two lives&mdash;the conscious or
the unconscious&mdash;is held by the asker to be the truer
life.&nbsp; Which does the question contemplate&mdash;the life we
know, or the life which others may know, but which we know
not?</p>
<p>Death gives a life to some men and women compared with which
their so-called existence here is as nothing.&nbsp; Which is the
truer life of Shakespeare, Handel, that divine woman who wrote
the &ldquo;Odyssey,&rdquo; and of Jane Austen&mdash;the life
which palpitated with sensible warm motion within their own
bodies, or that in virtue of which they are still palpitating in
ours?&nbsp; In whose consciousness does their truest life
consist&mdash;their own, or ours?&nbsp; Can Shakespeare be said
to have begun his true life till a hundred years or so after he
was dead and buried?&nbsp; His physical life was but as an
embryonic stage, a coming up out of darkness, a twilight and dawn
before the sunrise of that life of the world to come which he was
to enjoy hereafter.&nbsp; We all live for a while after we are
gone hence, but we are for the most part stillborn, or at any
rate die in infancy, as regards that life which every age and
country has recognised as higher and truer than the one of which
we are now sentient.&nbsp; As the life of the race is larger,
longer, and in all respects more to be considered than that of
the individual, so is the life we live in others larger and more
important than the one we live in ourselves.&nbsp; This appears
nowhere perhaps more plainly than in the case of great teachers,
who often in the lives of their pupils produce an effect that
reaches far beyond anything produced while their single lives
were yet unsupplemented by those other lives into which they
infused their own.</p>
<p>Death to such people is the ending of a short life, but it
does not touch the life they are already living in those whom
they have taught; and happily, as none can know when he shall
die, so none can make sure that he too shall not live long beyond
the grave; for the life after death is like money before
it&mdash;no one can be sure that it may not fall to him or her
even at the eleventh hour.&nbsp; Money and immortality come in
such odd unaccountable ways that no one is cut off from
hope.&nbsp; We may not have made either of them for ourselves,
but yet another may give them to us in virtue of his or her love,
which shall illumine us for ever, and establish us in some
heavenly mansion whereof we neither dreamed nor shall ever
dream.&nbsp; Look at the Doge Loredano Loredani, the old
man&rsquo;s smile upon whose face has been reproduced so
faithfully in so many lands that it can never henceforth be
forgotten&mdash;would he have had one hundredth part of the life
he now lives had he not been linked awhile with one of those
heaven-sent men who know <i>che cosa &egrave; amor</i>?&nbsp;
Look at Rembrandt&rsquo;s old woman in our National Gallery; had
she died before she was eighty-three years old she would not have
been living now.&nbsp; Then, when she was eighty-three,
immortality perched upon her as a bird on a withered bough.</p>
<p>I seem to hear some one say that this is a mockery, a piece of
special pleading, a giving of stones to those that ask for
bread.&nbsp; Life is not life unless we can feel it, and a life
limited to a knowledge of such fraction of our work as may happen
to survive us is no true life in other people; salve it as we
may, death is not life any more than black is white.</p>
<p>The objection is not so true as it sounds.&nbsp; I do not deny
that we had rather not die, nor do I pretend that much even in
the case of the most favoured few can survive them beyond the
grave.&nbsp; It is only because this is so that our own life is
possible; others have made room for us, and we should make room
for others in our turn without undue repining.&nbsp; What I
maintain is that a not inconsiderable number of people do
actually attain to a life beyond the grave which we can all feel
forcibly enough, whether they can do so or not&mdash;that this
life tends with increasing civilisation to become more and more
potent, and that it is better worth considering, in spite of its
being unfelt by ourselves, than any which we have felt or can
ever feel in our own persons.</p>
<p>Take an extreme case.&nbsp; A group of people are photographed
by Edison&rsquo;s new process&mdash;say Titiens, Trebelli, and
Jenny Lind, with any two of the finest men singers the age has
known&mdash;let them be photographed incessantly for half an hour
while they perform a scene in &ldquo;Lohengrin&rdquo;; let all be
done stereoscopically.&nbsp; Let them be phonographed at the same
time so that their minutest shades of intonation are preserved,
let the slides be coloured by a competent artist, and then let
the scene be called suddenly into sight and sound, say a hundred
years hence.&nbsp; Are those people dead or alive?&nbsp; Dead to
themselves they are, but while they live so powerfully and so
livingly in us, which is the greater paradox&mdash;to say that
they are alive or that they are dead?&nbsp; To myself it seems
that their life in others would be more truly life than their
death to themselves is death.&nbsp; Granted that they do not
present all the phenomena of life&mdash;who ever does so even
when he is held to be alive?&nbsp; We are held to be alive
because we present a sufficient number of living phenomena to let
the others go without saying; those who see us take the part for
the whole here as in everything else, and surely, in the case
supposed above, the phenomena of life predominate so powerfully
over those of death, that the people themselves must be held to
be more alive than dead.&nbsp; Our living personality is, as the
word implies, only our mask, and those who still own such a mask
as I have supposed have a living personality.&nbsp; Granted again
that the case just put is an extreme one; still many a man and
many a woman has so stamped him or herself on his work that,
though we would gladly have the aid of such accessories as we
doubtless presently shall have to the livingness of our great
dead, we can see them very sufficiently through the master pieces
they have left us.</p>
<p>As for their own unconsciousness I do not deny it.&nbsp; The
life of the embryo was unconscious before birth, and so is the
life&mdash;I am speaking only of the life revealed to us by
natural religion&mdash;after death.&nbsp; But as the embryonic
and infant life of which we were unconscious was the most potent
factor in our after life of consciousness, so the effect which we
may unconsciously produce in others after death, and it may be
even before it on those who have never seen us, is in all sober
seriousness our truer and more abiding life, and the one which
those who would make the best of their sojourn here will take
most into their consideration.</p>
<p>Unconsciousness is no bar to livingness.&nbsp; Our conscious
actions are a drop in the sea as compared with our unconscious
ones.&nbsp; Could we know all the life that is in us by way of
circulation, nutrition, breathing, waste and repair, we should
learn what an infinitesimally small part consciousness plays in
our present existence; yet our unconscious life is as truly life
as our conscious life, and though it is unconscious to itself it
emerges into an indirect and vicarious consciousness in our other
and conscious self, which exists but in virtue of our unconscious
self.&nbsp; So we have also a vicarious consciousness in
others.&nbsp; The unconscious life of those that have gone before
us has in great part moulded us into such men and women as we
are, and our own unconscious lives will in like manner have a
vicarious consciousness in others, though we be dead enough to it
in ourselves.</p>
<p>If it is again urged that it matters not to us how much we may
be alive in others, if we are to know nothing about it, I reply
that the common instinct of all who are worth considering gives
the lie to such cynicism.&nbsp; I see here present some who have
achieved, and others who no doubt will achieve, success in
literature.&nbsp; Will one of them hesitate to admit that it is a
lively pleasure to her to feel that on the other side of the
world some one may be smiling happily over her work, and that she
is thus living in that person though she knows nothing about
it?&nbsp; Here it seems to me that true faith comes in.&nbsp;
Faith does not consist, as the Sunday School pupil said,
&ldquo;in the power of believing that which we know to be
untrue.&rdquo;&nbsp; It consists in holding fast that which the
healthiest and most kindly instincts of the best and most
sensible men and women are intuitively possessed of, without
caring to require much evidence further than the fact that such
people are so convinced; and for my own part I find the best men
and women I know unanimous in feeling that life in others, even
though we know nothing about it, is nevertheless a thing to be
desired and gratefully accepted if we can get it either before
death or after.&nbsp; I observe also that a large number of men
and women do actually attain to such life, and in some cases
continue so to live, if not for ever, yet to what is practically
much the same thing.&nbsp; Our life then in this world is, to
natural religion as much as to revealed, a period of
probation.&nbsp; The use we make of it is to settle how far we
are to enter into another, and whether that other is to be a
heaven of just affection or a hell of righteous condemnation.</p>
<p>Who, then, are the most likely so to run that they may obtain
this veritable prize of our high calling?&nbsp; Setting aside
such lucky numbers drawn as it were in the lottery of
immortality, which I have referred to casually above, and setting
aside also the chances and changes from which even immortality is
not exempt, who on the whole are most likely to live anew in the
affectionate thoughts of those who never so much as saw them in
the flesh, and know not even their names?&nbsp; There is a
<i>nisus</i>, a straining in the dull dumb economy of things, in
virtue of which some, whether they will it and know it or no, are
more likely to live after death than others, and who are
these?&nbsp; Those who aimed at it as by some great thing that
they would do to make them famous?&nbsp; Those who have lived
most in themselves and for themselves, or those who have been
most ensouled consciously, but perhaps better unconsciously,
directly but more often indirectly, by the most living souls past
and present that have flitted near them?&nbsp; Can we think of a
man or woman who grips us firmly, at the thought of whom we
kindle when we are alone in our honest daw&rsquo;s plumes, with
none to admire or shrug his shoulders, can we think of one such,
the secret of whose power does not lie in the charm of his or her
personality&mdash;that is to say, in the wideness of his or her
sympathy with, and therefore life in and communion with other
people?&nbsp; In the wreckage that comes ashore from the sea of
time there is much tinsel stuff that we must preserve and study
if we would know our own times and people; granted that many a
dead charlatan lives long and enters largely and necessarily into
our own lives; we use them and throw them away when we have done
with them.&nbsp; I do not speak of these, I do not speak of the
Virgils and Alexander Popes, and who can say how many more whose
names I dare not mention for fear of offending.&nbsp; They are as
stuffed birds or beasts in a Museum, serviceable no doubt from a
scientific standpoint, but with no vivid or vivifying hold upon
us.&nbsp; They seem to be alive, but are not.&nbsp; I am speaking
of those who do actually live in us, and move us to higher
achievements though they be long dead, whose life thrusts out our
own and overrides it.&nbsp; I speak of those who draw us ever
more towards them from youth to age, and to think of whom is to
feel at once that we are in the hands of those we love, and whom
we would most wish to resemble.&nbsp; What is the secret of the
hold that these people have upon us?&nbsp; Is it not that while,
conventionally speaking, alive, they most merged their lives in,
and were in fullest communion with those among whom they
lived?&nbsp; They found their lives in losing them.&nbsp; We
never love the memory of any one unless we feel that he or she
was himself or herself a lover.</p>
<p>I have seen it urged, again, in querulous accents, that the
so-called immortality even of the most immortal is not for
ever.&nbsp; I see a passage to this effect in a book that is
making a stir as I write.&nbsp; I will quote it.&nbsp; The writer
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;So, it seems to me, is the immortality we
so glibly predicate of departed artists.&nbsp; If they survive at
all, it is but a shadowy life they live, moving on through the
gradations of slow decay to distant but inevitable death.&nbsp;
They can no longer, as heretofore, speak directly to the hearts
of their fellow-men, evoking their tears or laughter, and all the
pleasures, be they sad or merry, of which imagination holds the
secret.&nbsp; Driven from the marketplace they become first the
companions of the student, then the victims of the
specialist.&nbsp; He who would still hold familiar intercourse
with them must train himself to penetrate the veil which in
ever-thickening folds conceals them from the ordinary gaze; he
must catch the tone of a vanished society, he must move in a
circle of alien associations, he must think in a language not his
own.&rdquo; <a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is crying for the moon, or rather pretending to cry for
it, for the writer is obviously insincere.&nbsp; I see the
<i>Saturday Review</i> says the passage I have just quoted
&ldquo;reaches almost to poetry,&rdquo; and indeed I find many
blank verses in it, some of them very aggressive.&nbsp; No prose
is free from an occasional blank verse, and a good writer will
not go hunting over his work to rout them out, but nine or ten in
little more than as many lines is indeed reaching too near to
poetry for good prose.&nbsp; This, however, is a trifle, and
might pass if the tone of the writer was not so obviously that of
cheap pessimism.&nbsp; I know not which is cheapest, pessimism or
optimism.&nbsp; One forces lights, the other darks; both are
equally untrue to good art, and equally sure of their effect with
the groundlings.&nbsp; The one extenuates, the other sets down in
malice.&nbsp; The first is the more amiable lie, but both are
lies, and are known to be so by those who utter them.&nbsp; Talk
about catching the tone of a vanished society to understand
Rembrandt or Giovanni Bellini!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
nonsense&mdash;the folds do not thicken in front of these men; we
understand them as well as those among whom they went about in
the flesh, and perhaps better.&nbsp; Homer and Shakespeare speak
to us probably far more effectually than they did to the men of
their own time, and most likely we have them at their best.&nbsp;
I cannot think that Shakespeare talked better than we hear him
now in &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; or &ldquo;Henry the Fourth&rdquo;;
like enough he would have been found a very disappointing person
in a drawing-room.&nbsp; People stamp themselves on their work;
if they have not done so they are naught; if they have we have
them; and for the most part they stamp themselves deeper in their
work than on their talk.&nbsp; No doubt Shakespeare and Handel
will be one day clean forgotten, as though they had never been
born.&nbsp; The world will in the end die; mortality therefore
itself is not immortal, and when death dies the life of these men
will die with it&mdash;but not sooner.&nbsp; It is enough that
they should live within us and move us for many ages as they have
and will.&nbsp; Such immortality, therefore, as some men and
women are born to, achieve, or have thrust upon them, is a
practical if not a technical immortality, and he who would have
more let him have nothing.</p>
<p>I see I have drifted into speaking rather of how to make the
best of death than of life, but who can speak of life without his
thoughts turning instantly to that which is beyond it?&nbsp; He
or she who has made the best of the life after death has made the
best of the life before it; who cares one straw for any such
chances and changes as will commonly befall him here if he is
upheld by the full and certain hope of everlasting life in the
affections of those that shall come after?&nbsp; If the life
after death is happy in the hearts of others, it matters little
how unhappy was the life before it.</p>
<p>And now I leave my subject, not without misgiving that I shall
have disappointed you.&nbsp; But for the great attention which is
being paid to the work from which I have quoted above, I should
not have thought it well to insist on points with which you are,
I doubt not, as fully impressed as I am: but that book weakens
the sanctions of natural religion, and minimises the comfort
which it affords us, while it does more to undermine than to
support the foundations of what is commonly called belief.&nbsp;
Therefore I was glad to embrace this opportunity of
protesting.&nbsp; Otherwise I should not have been so serious on
a matter that transcends all seriousness.&nbsp; Lord Beaconsfield
cut it shorter with more effect.&nbsp; When asked to give a rule
of life for the son of a friend he said, &ldquo;Do not let him
try and find out who wrote the letters of Junius.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Pressed for further counsel he added, &ldquo;Nor yet who was the
man in the iron mask&rdquo;&mdash;and he would say no more.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t bore people.&nbsp; And yet I am by no means sure that
a good many people do not think themselves ill-used unless he who
addresses them has thoroughly well bored them&mdash;especially if
they have paid any money for hearing him.&nbsp; My great namesake
said, &ldquo;Surely the pleasure is as great of being cheated as
to cheat,&rdquo; and great as the pleasure both of cheating and
boring undoubtedly is, I believe he was right.&nbsp; So I
remember a poem which came out some thirty years ago in
<i>Punch</i>, about a young lady who went forth in quest to
&ldquo;Some burden make or burden bear, but which she did not
greatly care, oh Miserie.&rdquo;&nbsp; So, again, all the holy
men and women who in the Middle Ages professed to have discovered
how to make the best of life took care that being bored, if not
cheated, should have a large place in their programme.&nbsp;
Still there are limits, and I close not without fear that I may
have exceeded them.</p>
<h2>THE SANCTUARY OF MONTRIGONE <a name="citation6"></a><a
href="#footnote6" class="citation">[6]</a></h2>
<p>The only place in the Valsesia, except Varallo, where I at
present suspect the presence of Tabachetti <a
name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7"
class="citation">[7]</a> is at Montrigone, a little-known
sanctuary dedicated to St. Anne, about three-quarters of a mile
south of Borgo-Sesia station.&nbsp; The situation is, of course,
lovely, but the sanctuary does not offer any features of
architectural interest.&nbsp; The sacristan told me it was
founded in 1631; and in 1644 Giovanni d&rsquo;Enrico, while
engaged in superintending and completing the work undertaken here
by himself and Giacomo Ferro, fell ill and died.&nbsp; I do not
know whether or no there was an earlier sanctuary on the same
site, but was told it was built on the demolition of a stronghold
belonging to the Counts of Biandrate.</p>
<p>The incidents which it illustrates are treated with even more
than the homeliness usual in works of this description when not
dealing with such solemn events as the death and passion of
Christ.&nbsp; Except when these subjects were being represented,
something of the latitude, and even humour, allowed in the old
mystery plays was permitted, doubtless from a desire to render
the work more attractive to the peasants, who were the most
numerous and most important pilgrims.&nbsp; It is not until faith
begins to be weak that it fears an occasionally lighter treatment
of semi-sacred subjects, and it is impossible to convey an
accurate idea of the spirit prevailing at this hamlet of
sanctuary without attuning oneself somewhat to the more pagan
character of the place.&nbsp; Of irreverence, in the sense of a
desire to laugh at things that are of high and serious import,
there is not a trace, but at the same time there is a certain
unbending of the bow at Montrigone which is not perceivable at
Varallo.</p>
<p>The first chapel to the left on entering the church is that of
the Birth of the Virgin.&nbsp; St. Anne is sitting up in
bed.&nbsp; She is not at all ill&mdash;in fact, considering that
the Virgin has only been born about five minutes, she is
wonderful; still the doctors think it may be perhaps better that
she should keep her room for half an hour longer, so the bed has
been festooned with red and white paper roses, and the
counterpane is covered with bouquets in baskets and in vases of
glass and china.&nbsp; These cannot have been there during the
actual birth of the Virgin, so I suppose they had been in
readiness, and were brought in from an adjoining room as soon as
the baby had been born.&nbsp; A lady on her left is bringing in
some more flowers, which St. Anne is receiving with a smile and
most gracious gesture of the hands.&nbsp; The first thing she
asked for, when the birth was over, was for her three silver
hearts.&nbsp; These were immediately brought to her, and she has
got them all on, tied round her neck with a piece of blue silk
ribbon.</p>
<p>Dear mamma has come.&nbsp; We felt sure she would, and that
any little misunderstandings between her and Joachim would ere
long be forgotten and forgiven.&nbsp; They are both so good and
sensible if they would only understand one another.&nbsp; At any
rate, here she is, in high state at the right hand of the
bed.&nbsp; She is dressed in black, for she has lost her husband
some few years previously, but I do not believe a smarter, sprier
old lady for her years could be found in Palestine, nor yet that
either Giovanni d&rsquo;Enrico or Giacomo Ferro could have
conceived or executed such a character.&nbsp; The sacristan
wanted to have it that she was not a woman at all, but was a
portrait of St. Joachim, the Virgin&rsquo;s father.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sembra una donna,&rdquo; he pleaded more than once,
&ldquo;ma non &egrave; donna.&rdquo;&nbsp; Surely, however, in
works of art even more than in other things, there is no
&ldquo;is&rdquo; but seeming, and if a figure seems female it
must be taken as such.&nbsp; Besides, I asked one of the leading
doctors at Varallo whether the figure was man or woman.&nbsp; He
said it was evident I was not married, for that if I had been I
should have seen at once that she was not only a woman but a
mother-in-law of the first magnitude, or, as he called it,
&ldquo;una suocera tremenda,&rdquo; and this without knowing that
I wanted her to be a mother-in-law myself.&nbsp; Unfortunately
she had no real drapery, so I could not settle the question as my
friend Mr. H. F. Jones and I had been able to do at Varallo with
the figure of Eve that had been turned into a Roman soldier
assisting at the capture of Christ.&nbsp; I am not, however,
disposed to waste more time upon anything so obvious, and will
content myself with saying that we have here the Virgin&rsquo;s
grandmother.&nbsp; I had never had the pleasure, so far as I
remembered, of meeting this lady before, and was glad to have an
opportunity of making her acquaintance.</p>
<p>Tradition says that it was she who chose the Virgin&rsquo;s
name, and if so, what a debt of gratitude do we not owe her for
her judicious selection!&nbsp; It makes one shudder to think what
might have happened if she had named the child Keren-Happuch, as
poor Job&rsquo;s daughter was called.&nbsp; How could we have
said, &ldquo;Ave Keren-Happuch!&rdquo;&nbsp; What would the
musicians have done?&nbsp; I forget whether Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz
was a man or a woman, but there were plenty of names quite as
unmanageable at the Virgin&rsquo;s grandmother&rsquo;s option,
and we cannot sufficiently thank her for having chosen one that
is so euphonious in every language which we need take into
account.&nbsp; For this reason alone we should not grudge her her
portrait, but we should try to draw the line here.&nbsp; I do not
think we ought to give the Virgin&rsquo;s great-grandmother a
statue.&nbsp; Where is it to end?&nbsp; It is like Mr.
Crookes&rsquo;s ultimissimate atoms; we used to draw the line at
ultimate atoms, and now it seems we are to go a step farther back
and have ultimissimate atoms.&nbsp; How long, I wonder, will it
be before we feel that it will be a material help to us to have
ultimissimissimate atoms?&nbsp; Quavers stopped at
demi-semi-demi, but there is no reason to suppose that either
atoms or ancestresses of the Virgin will be so complacent.</p>
<p>I have said that on St. Anne&rsquo;s left hand there is a lady
who is bringing in some flowers.&nbsp; St. Anne was always
passionately fond of flowers.&nbsp; There is a pretty story told
about her in one of the Fathers, I forget which, to the effect
that when a child she was asked which she liked best&mdash;cakes
or flowers?&nbsp; She could not yet speak plainly and lisped out,
&ldquo;Oh fowses, pretty fowses&rdquo;; she added, however, with
a sigh and as a kind of wistful corollary, &ldquo;but cakes are
very nice.&rdquo;&nbsp; She is not to have any cakes, just now,
but as soon as she has done thanking the lady for her beautiful
nosegay, she is to have a couple of nice new-laid eggs, that are
being brought her by another lady.&nbsp; Valsesian women
immediately after their confinement always have eggs beaten up
with wine and sugar, and one can tell a Valsesian Birth of the
Virgin from a Venetian or a Florentine by the presence of the
eggs.&nbsp; I learned this from an eminent Valsesian professor of
medicine, who told me that, though not according to received
rules, the eggs never seemed to do any harm.&nbsp; Here they are
evidently to be beaten up, for there is neither spoon nor
egg-cup, and we cannot suppose that they were hard-boiled.&nbsp;
On the other hand, in the Middle Ages Italians never used
egg-cups and spoons for boiled eggs.&nbsp; The medi&aelig;val
boiled egg was always eaten by dipping bread into the yolk.</p>
<p>Behind the lady who is bringing in the eggs is the
under-under-nurse who is at the fire warming a towel.&nbsp; In
the foreground we have the regulation midwife holding the
regulation baby (who, by the way, was an astonishingly fine child
for only five minutes old).&nbsp; Then comes the
under-nurse&mdash;a good buxom creature, who, as usual, is
feeling the water in the bath to see that it is of the right
temperature.&nbsp; Next to her is the head-nurse, who is
arranging the cradle.&nbsp; Behind the head-nurse is the
under-under-nurse&rsquo;s drudge, who is just going out upon some
errands.&nbsp; Lastly&mdash;for by this time we have got all
round the chapel&mdash;we arrive at the Virgin&rsquo;s
grandmother&rsquo;s-body-guard, a stately, responsible-looking
lady, standing in waiting upon her mistress.&nbsp; I put it to
the reader&mdash;is it conceivable that St. Joachim should have
been allowed in such a room at such a time, or that he should
have had the courage to avail himself of the permission, even
though it had been extended to him?&nbsp; At any rate, is it
conceivable that he should have been allowed to sit on St.
Anne&rsquo;s right hand, laying down the law with a &ldquo;Marry,
come up here,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Marry, go-down there,&rdquo;
and a couple of such unabashed collars as the old lady has put on
for the occasion?</p>
<p>Moreover (for I may as well demolish this mischievous
confusion between St. Joachim and his mother-in-law once and for
all), the merest tyro in hagiology knows that St. Joachim was not
at home when the Virgin was born.&nbsp; He had been hustled out
of the temple for having no children, and had fled desolate and
dismayed into the wilderness.&nbsp; It shows how silly people
are, for all the time he was going, if they had only waited a
little, to be the father of the most remarkable person of purely
human origin who had ever been born, and such a parent as this
should surely not be hurried.&nbsp; The story is told in the
frescoes of the chapel of Loreto, only a quarter of an
hour&rsquo;s walk from Varallo, and no one can have known it
better than D&rsquo;Enrico.&nbsp; The frescoes are explained by
written passages that tell us how, when Joachim was in the
desert, an angel came to him in the guise of a fair, civil young
gentleman, and told him the Virgin was to be born.&nbsp; Then,
later on, the same young gentleman appeared to him again, and
bade him &ldquo;in God&rsquo;s name be comforted, and turn again
to his content,&rdquo; for the Virgin had been actually
born.&nbsp; On which St. Joachim, who seems to have been of
opinion that marriage after all <i>was</i> rather a failure, said
that, as things were going on so nicely without him, he would
stay in the desert just a little longer, and offered up a lamb as
a pretext to gain time.&nbsp; Perhaps he guessed about his
mother-in-law, or he may have asked the angel.&nbsp; Of course,
even in spite of such evidence as this I may be mistaken about
the Virgin&rsquo;s grandmother&rsquo;s sex, and the sacristan may
be right; but I can only say that if the lady sitting by St.
Anne&rsquo;s bedside at Montrigone is the Virgin&rsquo;s
father&mdash;well, in that case I must reconsider a good deal
that I have been accustomed to believe was beyond question.</p>
<p>Taken singly, I suppose that none of the figures in the
chapel, except the Virgin&rsquo;s grandmother, should be rated
very highly.&nbsp; The under-nurse is the next best figure, and
might very well be Tabachetti&rsquo;s, for neither Giovanni
d&rsquo;Enrico nor Giacomo Ferro was successful with his female
characters.&nbsp; There is not a single really comfortable woman
in any chapel by either of them on the Sacro Monte at
Varallo.&nbsp; Tabachetti, on the other hand, delighted in women;
if they were young he made them comely and engaging, if they were
old he gave them dignity and individual character, and the
under-nurse is much more in accordance with Tabachetti&rsquo;s
habitual mental attitude than with D&rsquo;Enrico&rsquo;s or
Giacomo Ferro&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Still there are only four figures
out of the eleven that are mere otiose supers, and taking the
work as a whole it leaves a pleasant impression as being
throughout na&iuml;ve and homely, and sometimes, which is of less
importance, technically excellent.</p>
<p>Allowance must, of course, be made for tawdry accessories and
repeated coats of shiny oleaginous paint&mdash;very disagreeable
where it has peeled off and almost more so where it has
not.&nbsp; What work could stand against such treatment as the
Valsesian terra-cotta figures have had to put up with?&nbsp; Take
the Venus of Milo; let her be done in terra-cotta, and have run,
not much, but still something, in the baking; paint her pink, two
oils, all over, and then varnish her&mdash;it will help to
preserve the paint; glue a lot of horsehair on to her pate, half
of which shall have come off, leaving the glue still showing;
scrape her, not too thoroughly, get the village drawing-master to
paint her again, and the drawing-master in the next provincial
town to put a forest background behind her with the brightest
emerald-green leaves that he can do for the money; let this
painting and scraping and repainting be repeated several times
over; festoon her with pink and white flowers made of tissue
paper; surround her with the cheapest German imitations of the
cheapest decorations that Birmingham can produce; let the night
air and winter fogs get at her for three hundred years, and how
easy, I wonder, will it be to see the goddess who will be still
in great part there?&nbsp; True, in the case of the Birth of the
Virgin chapel at Montrigone, there is no real hair and no fresco
background, but time has had abundant opportunities without
these.&nbsp; I will conclude my notice of this chapel by saying
that on the left, above the door through which the
under-under-nurse&rsquo;s drudge is about to pass, there is a
good painted terra-cotta bust, said&mdash;but I believe on no
authority&mdash;to be a portrait of Giovanni
d&rsquo;Enrico.&nbsp; Others say that the Virgin&rsquo;s
grandmother is Giovanni d&rsquo;Enrico, but this is even more
absurd than supposing her to be St. Joachim.</p>
<p>The next chapel to the Birth of the Virgin is that of the
<i>Sposalizio</i>.&nbsp; There is no figure here which suggests
Tabachetti, but still there are some very good ones.&nbsp; The
best have no taint of <i>barocco</i>; the man who did them,
whoever he may have been, had evidently a good deal of life and
go, was taking reasonable pains, and did not know too much.&nbsp;
Where this is the case no work can fail to please.&nbsp; Some of
the figures have real hair and some terra cotta.&nbsp; There is
no fresco background worth mentioning.&nbsp; A man sitting on the
steps of the altar with a book on his lap, and holding up his
hand to another, who is leaning over him and talking to him, is
among the best figures; some of the disappointed suitors who are
breaking their wands are also very good.</p>
<p>The angel in the Annunciation chapel, which comes next in
order, is a fine, burly, ship&rsquo;s-figurehead,
commercial-hotel sort of being enough, but the Virgin is very
ordinary.&nbsp; There is no real hair and no fresco background,
only three dingy old blistered pictures of no interest
whatever.</p>
<p>In the visit of Mary to Elizabeth there are three pleasing
subordinate lady attendants, two to the left and one to the right
of the principal figures; but these figures themselves are not
satisfactory.&nbsp; There is no fresco background.&nbsp; Some of
the figures have real hair and some terra cotta.</p>
<p>In the Circumcision and Purification chapel&mdash;for both
these events seem contemplated in the one that
follows&mdash;there are doves, but there is neither dog nor
knife.&nbsp; Still Simeon, who has the infant Saviour in his
arms, is looking at him in a way which can only mean that, knife
or no knife, the matter is not going to end here.&nbsp; At
Varallo they have now got a dreadful knife for the Circumcision
chapel.&nbsp; They had none last winter.&nbsp; What they have now
got would do very well to kill a bullock with, but could not be
used professionally with safety for any animal smaller than a
rhinoceros.&nbsp; I imagine that some one was sent to Novara to
buy a knife, and that, thinking it was for the Massacre of the
Innocents chapel, he got the biggest he could see.&nbsp; Then
when he brought it back people said &ldquo;chow&rdquo; several
times, and put it upon the table and went away.</p>
<p>Returning to Montrigone, the Simeon is an excellent figure,
and the Virgin is fairly good, but the prophetess Anna, who
stands just behind her, is by far the most interesting in the
group, and is alone enough to make me feel sure that Tabachetti
gave more or less help here, as he had done years before at
Orta.&nbsp; She, too, like the Virgin&rsquo;s grandmother, is a
widow lady, and wears collars of a cut that seems to have
prevailed ever since the Virgin was born some twenty years
previously.&nbsp; There is a largeness and simplicity of
treatment about the figure to which none but an artist of the
highest rank can reach, and D&rsquo;Enrico was not more than a
second or third-rate man.&nbsp; The hood is like Handel&rsquo;s
Truth sailing upon the broad wings of Time, a prophetic strain
that nothing but the old experience of a great poet can
reach.&nbsp; The lips of the prophetess are for the moment
closed, but she has been prophesying all the morning, and the
people round the wall in the background are in ecstasies at the
lucidity with which she has explained all sorts of difficulties
that they had never been able to understand till now.&nbsp; They
are putting their forefingers on their thumbs and their thumbs on
their forefingers, and saying how clearly they see it all and
what a wonderful woman Anna is.&nbsp; A prophet indeed is not
generally without honour save in his own country, but then a
country is generally not without honour save with its own
prophet, and Anna has been glorifying her country rather than
reviling it.&nbsp; Besides, the rule may not have applied to
prophetesses.</p>
<p>The Death of the Virgin is the last of the six chapels inside
the church itself.&nbsp; The Apostles, who of course are present,
have all of them real hair, but, if I may say so, they want a
wash and a brush-up so very badly that I cannot feel any
confidence in writing about them.&nbsp; I should say that, take
them all round, they are a good average sample of apostle as
apostles generally go.&nbsp; Two or three of them are nervously
anxious to find appropriate quotations in books that lie open
before them, which they are searching with eager haste; but I do
not see one figure about which I should like to say positively
that it is either good or bad.&nbsp; There is a good bust of a
man, matching the one in the Birth of the Virgin chapel, which is
said to be a portrait of Giovanni d&rsquo;Enrico, but it is not
known whom it represents.</p>
<p>Outside the church, in three contiguous cells that form part
of the foundations, are:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; A dead Christ, the head of which is very impressive
while the rest of the figure is poor.&nbsp; I examined the
treatment of the hair, which is terra-cotta, and compared it with
all other like hair in the chapels above described; I could find
nothing like it, and think it most likely that Giacomo Ferro did
the figure, and got Tabachetti to do the head, or that they
brought the head from some unused figure by Tabachetti at
Varallo, for I know no other artist of the time and neighbourhood
who could have done it.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; A Magdalene in the desert.&nbsp; The desert is a
little coal-cellar of an arch, containing a skull and a profusion
of pink and white paper bouquets, the two largest of which the
Magdalene is hugging while she is saying her prayers.&nbsp; She
is a very self-sufficient lady, who we may be sure will not stay
in the desert a day longer than she can help, and while there
will flirt even with the skull if she can find nothing better to
flirt with.&nbsp; I cannot think that her repentance is as yet
genuine, and as for her praying there is no object in her doing
so, for she does not want anything.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; In the next desert there is a very beautiful figure
of St. John the Baptist kneeling and looking upwards.&nbsp; This
figure puzzles me more than any other at Montrigone; it appears
to be of the fifteenth rather than the sixteenth century; it
hardly reminds me of Gaudenzio, and still less of any other
Valsesian artist.&nbsp; It is a work of unusual beauty, but I can
form no idea as to its authorship.</p>
<p>I wrote the foregoing pages in the church at Montrigone
itself, having brought my camp-stool with me.&nbsp; It was
Sunday; the church was open all day, but there was no mass said,
and hardly any one came.&nbsp; The sacristan was a kind, gentle,
little old man, who let me do whatever I wanted.&nbsp; He sat on
the doorstep of the main door, mending vestments, and to this end
was cutting up a fine piece of figured silk from one to two
hundred years old, which, if I could have got it, for half its
value, I should much like to have bought.&nbsp; I sat in the cool
of the church while he sat in the doorway, which was still in
shadow, snipping and snipping, and then sewing, I am sure with
admirable neatness.&nbsp; He made a charming picture, with the
arched portico over his head, the green grass and low church wall
behind him, and then a lovely landscape of wood and pasture and
valleys and hillside.&nbsp; Every now and then he would come and
chirrup about Joachim, for he was pained and shocked at my having
said that his Joachim was some one else and not Joachim at
all.&nbsp; I said I was very sorry, but I was afraid the figure
was a woman.&nbsp; He asked me what he was to do.&nbsp; He had
known it, man and boy, this sixty years, and had always shown it
as St. Joachim; he had never heard any one but myself question
his ascription, and could not suddenly change his mind about it
at the bidding of a stranger.&nbsp; At the same time he felt it
was a very serious thing to continue showing it as the
Virgin&rsquo;s father if it was really her grandmother.&nbsp; I
told him I thought this was a case for his spiritual director,
and that if he felt uncomfortable about it he should consult his
parish priest and do as he was told.</p>
<p>On leaving Montrigone, with a pleasant sense of having made
acquaintance with a new and, in many respects, interesting work,
I could not get the sacristan and our difference of opinion out
of my head.&nbsp; What, I asked myself, are the differences that
unhappily divide Christendom, and what are those that divide
Christendom from modern schools of thought, but a seeing of
Joachims as the Virgin&rsquo;s grandmothers on a larger
scale?&nbsp; True, we cannot call figures Joachim when we know
perfectly well that they are nothing of the kind; but I
registered a vow that henceforward when I called Joachims the
Virgin&rsquo;s grandmothers I would bear more in mind than I have
perhaps always hitherto done, how hard it is for those who have
been taught to see them as Joachims to think of them as something
different.&nbsp; I trust that I have not been unfaithful to this
vow in the preceding article.&nbsp; If the reader differs from
me, let me ask him to remember how hard it is for one who has got
a figure well into his head as the Virgin&rsquo;s grandmother to
see it as Joachim.</p>
<h2>A MEDIEVAL GIRL SCHOOL <a name="citation8"></a><a
href="#footnote8" class="citation">[8]</a></h2>
<p>This last summer I revisited Oropa, near Biella, to see what
connection I could find between the Oropa chapels and those at
Varallo.&nbsp; I will take this opportunity of describing the
chapels at Oropa, and more especially the remarkable fossil, or
petrified girl school, commonly known as the <i>Dimora</i>, or
Sojourn of the Virgin Mary in the Temple.</p>
<p>If I do not take these works so seriously as the reader may
expect, let me beg him, before he blames me, to go to Oropa and
see the originals for himself.&nbsp; Have the good people of
Oropa themselves taken them very seriously?&nbsp; Are we in an
atmosphere where we need be at much pains to speak with bated
breath?&nbsp; We, as is well known, love to take even our
pleasures sadly; the Italians take even their sadness
<i>allegramente</i>, and combine devotion with amusement in a
manner that we shall do well to study if not imitate.&nbsp; For
this best agrees with what we gather to have been the custom of
Christ himself, who, indeed, never speaks of austerity but to
condemn it.&nbsp; If Christianity is to be a living faith, it
must penetrate a man&rsquo;s whole life, so that he can no more
rid himself of it than he can of his flesh and bones or of his
breathing.&nbsp; The Christianity that can be taken up and laid
down as if it were a watch or a book is Christianity in name
only.&nbsp; The true Christian can no more part from Christ in
mirth than in sorrow.&nbsp; And, after all, what is the essence
of Christianity?&nbsp; What is the kernel of the nut?&nbsp;
Surely common sense and cheerfulness, with unflinching opposition
to the charlatanisms and Pharisaisms of a man&rsquo;s own
times.&nbsp; The essence of Christianity lies neither in dogma,
nor yet in abnormally holy life, but in faith in an unseen world,
in doing one&rsquo;s duty, in speaking the truth, in finding the
true life rather in others than in oneself, and in the certain
hope that he who loses his life on these behalfs finds more than
he has lost.&nbsp; What can Agnosticism do against such
Christianity as this?&nbsp; I should be shocked if anything I had
ever written or shall ever write should seem to make light of
these things.&nbsp; I should be shocked also if I did not know
how to be amused with things that amiable people obviously
intended to be amusing.</p>
<p>The reader may need to be reminded that Oropa is among the
somewhat infrequent sanctuaries at which the Madonna and infant
Christ are not white, but black.&nbsp; I shall return to this
peculiarity of Oropa later on, but will leave it for the
present.&nbsp; For the general characteristics of the place I
must refer the reader to my book, &ldquo;Alps and
Sanctuaries.&rdquo; <a name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9"
class="citation">[9]</a>&nbsp; I propose to confine myself here
to the ten or a dozen chapels containing life-sized terra-cotta
figures, painted up to nature, that form one of the main features
of the place.&nbsp; At a first glance, perhaps, all these chapels
will seem uninteresting; I venture to think, however, that some,
if not most of them, though falling a good deal short of the best
work at Varallo and Crea, are still in their own way of
considerable importance.&nbsp; The first chapel with which we
need concern ourselves is numbered 4, and shows the Conception of
the Virgin Mary.&nbsp; It represents St. Anne as kneeling before
a terrific dragon or, as the Italians call it,
&ldquo;insect,&rdquo; about the size of a Crystal Palace
pleiosaur.&nbsp; This &ldquo;insect&rdquo; is supposed to have
just had its head badly crushed by St. Anne, who seems to be
begging its pardon.&nbsp; The text &ldquo;Ipsa conteret caput
tuum&rdquo; is written outside the chapel.&nbsp; The figures have
no artistic interest.&nbsp; As regards dragons being called
insects, the reader may perhaps remember that the island of S.
Giulio, in the Lago d&rsquo;Orta, was infested with
<i>insetti</i>, which S. Giulio destroyed, and which appear, in a
fresco underneath the church on the island, to have been
monstrous and ferocious dragons; but I cannot remember whether
their bodies are divided into three sections, and whether or no
they have exactly six legs&mdash;without which, I am told, they
cannot be true insects.</p>
<p>The fifth chapel represents the birth of the Virgin.&nbsp;
Having obtained permission to go inside it, I found the date 1715
cut large and deep on the back of one figure before baking, and I
imagine that this date covers the whole.&nbsp; There is a Queen
Anne feeling throughout the composition, and if we were told that
the sculptor and Francis Bird, sculptor of the statue in front of
St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, had studied under the same master, we
could very well believe it.&nbsp; The apartment in which the
Virgin was born is spacious, and in striking contrast to the one
in which she herself gave birth to the Redeemer.&nbsp; St. Anne
occupies the centre of the composition, in an enormous bed; on
her right there is a lady of the George Cruikshank style of
beauty, and on the left an older person.&nbsp; Both are
gesticulating and impressing upon St. Anne the enormous
obligation she has just conferred upon mankind; they seem also to
be imploring her not to overtax her strength, but, strange to
say, they are giving her neither flowers nor anything to eat and
drink.&nbsp; I know no other birth of the Virgin in which St.
Anne wants so little keeping up.</p>
<p>I have explained in my book &ldquo;Ex Voto,&rdquo; <a
name="citation10"></a><a href="#footnote10"
class="citation">[10]</a> but should perhaps repeat here, that
the distinguishing characteristic of the Birth of the Virgin, as
rendered by Valsesian artists, is that St. Anne always has eggs
immediately after the infant is born, and usually a good deal
more, whereas the Madonna never has anything to eat or
drink.&nbsp; The eggs are in accordance with a custom that still
prevails among the peasant classes in the Valsesia, where women
on giving birth to a child generally are given a
<i>sabaglione</i>&mdash;an egg beaten up with a little wine, or
rum, and sugar.&nbsp; East of Milan the Virgin&rsquo;s mother
does not have eggs, and I suppose, from the absence of the eggs
at Oropa, that the custom above referred to does not prevail in
the Biellese district.&nbsp; The Virgin also is invariably
washed.&nbsp; St. John the Baptist, when he is born at all, which
is not very often, is also washed; but I have not observed that
St. Elizabeth has anything like the attention paid her that is
given to St. Anne.&nbsp; What, however, is wanting here at Oropa
in meat and drink is made up in Cupids; they swarm like flies on
the walls, clouds, cornices, and capitals of columns.</p>
<p>Against the right-hand wall are two lady-helps, each warming a
towel at a glowing fire, to be ready against the baby should come
out of its bath; while in the right-hand foreground we have the
<i>levatrice</i>, who having discharged her task, and being now
so disposed, has removed the bottle from the chimney-piece, and
put it near some bread, fruit and a chicken, over which she is
about to discuss the confinement with two other gossips.&nbsp;
The <i>levatrice</i> is a very characteristic figure, but the
best in the chapel is the one of the head nurse, near the middle
of the composition; she has now the infant in full charge, and is
showing it to St. Joachim, with an expression as though she were
telling him that her husband was a merry man.&nbsp; I am afraid
Shakespeare was dead before the sculptor was born, otherwise I
should have felt certain that he had drawn Juliet&rsquo;s nurse
from this figure.&nbsp; As for the little Virgin herself, I
believe her to be a fine boy of about ten months old.&nbsp;
Viewing the work as a whole, if I only felt more sure what
artistic merit really is, I should say that, though the chapel
cannot be rated very highly from some standpoints, there are
others from which it may be praised warmly enough.&nbsp; It is
innocent of anatomy-worship, free from affectation or swagger,
and not devoid of a good deal of homely
<i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>.&nbsp; It can no more be compared with
Tabachetti or Donatello than Hogarth can with Rembrandt or
Giovanni Bellini; but as it does not transcend the limitations of
its age, so neither is it wanting in whatever merits that age
possessed; and there is no age without merits of some kind.&nbsp;
There is no inscription saying who made the figures, but
tradition gives them to Pietro Aureggio Termine, of Biella,
commonly called Aureggio.&nbsp; This is confirmed by their strong
resemblance to those in the <i>Dimora</i> Chapel, in which there
is an inscription that names Aureggio as the sculptor.</p>
<p>The sixth chapel deals with the Presentation of the Virgin in
the Temple.&nbsp; The Virgin is very small, but it must be
remembered that she is only seven years old, and she is not
nearly so small as she is at Crea, where, though a life-sized
figure is intended, the head is hardly bigger than an
apple.&nbsp; She is rushing up the steps with open arms towards
the High Priest, who is standing at the top.&nbsp; For her it is
nothing alarming; it is the High Priest who appears frightened;
but it will all come right in time.&nbsp; The Virgin seems to be
saying, &ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you know me?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m the
Virgin Mary.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the High Priest does not feel so
sure about that, and will make further inquiries.&nbsp; The
scene, which comprises some twenty figures, is animated enough,
and though it hardly kindles enthusiasm, still does not fail to
please.&nbsp; It looks as though of somewhat older date than the
Birth of the Virgin chapel, and I should say shows more signs of
direct Valsesian influence.&nbsp; In Marocco&rsquo;s book about
Oropa it is ascribed to Aureggio, but I find it difficult to
accept this.</p>
<p>The seventh, and in many respects most interesting chapel at
Oropa, shows what is in reality a medieval Italian girl school,
as nearly like the thing itself as the artist could make it; we
are expected, however, to see in this the high-class kind of
Girton College for young gentlewomen that was attached to the
Temple at Jerusalem, under the direction of the Chief
Priest&rsquo;s wife, or some one of his near female
relatives.&nbsp; Here all well-to-do Jewish young women completed
their education, and here accordingly we find the Virgin, whose
parents desired she should shine in every accomplishment, and
enjoy all the advantages their ample means commanded.</p>
<p>I have met with no traces of the Virgin during the years
between her Presentation in the Temple and her becoming head girl
at Temple College.&nbsp; These years, we may be assured, can
hardly have been other than eventful; but incidents, or bits of
life, are like living forms&mdash;it is only here and here, as by
rare chance, that one of them gets arrested and fossilised; the
greater number disappear like the greater number of antediluvian
molluscs, and no one can say why one of these flies, as it were,
of life should get preserved in amber more than another.&nbsp;
Talk, indeed, about luck and cunning; what a grain of sand as
against a hundredweight is cunning&rsquo;s share here as against
luck&rsquo;s.&nbsp; What moment could be more humdrum and
unworthy of special record than the one chosen by the artist for
the chapel we are considering?&nbsp; Why should this one get
arrested in its flight and made immortal when so many worthier
ones have perished?&nbsp; Yet preserved it assuredly is; it is as
though some fairy&rsquo;s wand had struck the medieval Miss
Pinkerton, Amelia Sedley, and others who do duty instead of the
Hebrew originals.&nbsp; It has locked them up as sleeping
beauties, whose charms all may look upon.&nbsp; Surely the hours
are like the women grinding at the mill&mdash;the one is taken
and the other left, and none can give the reason more than he can
say why Gallio should have won immortality by caring for none of
&ldquo;these things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seems to me, moreover, that fairies have changed their
practice now in the matter of sleeping beauties, much as
shopkeepers have done in Regent Street.&nbsp; Formerly the
shopkeeper used to shut up his goods behind strong shutters, so
that no one might see them after closing hours.&nbsp; Now he
leaves everything open to the eye and turns the gas on.&nbsp; So
the fairies, who used to lock up their sleeping beauties in
impenetrable thickets, now leave them in the most public places
they can find, as knowing that they will there most certainly
escape notice.&nbsp; Look at De Hooghe; look at &ldquo;The
Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,&rdquo; or even Shakespeare
himself&mdash;how long they slept unawakened, though they were in
broad daylight and on the public thoroughfares all the
time.&nbsp; Look at Tabachetti, and the masterpieces he left at
Varallo.&nbsp; His figures there are exposed to the gaze of every
passer-by; yet who heeds them?&nbsp; Who, save a very few, even
know of their existence?&nbsp; Look again at Gaudenzio Ferrari,
or the &ldquo;Danse des Paysans,&rdquo; by Holbein, to which I
ventured to call attention in the <i>Universal Review</i>.&nbsp;
No, no; if a thing be in Central Africa, it is the glory of this
age to find it out; so the fairies think it safer to conceal
their <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;s</i> under a show of openness; for
the schoolmaster is much abroad, and there is no hedge so thick
or so thorny as the dulness of culture.</p>
<p>It may be, again, that ever so many years hence, when Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s earth-worms shall have buried Oropa hundreds of
feet deep, some one sinking a well or making a railway-cutting
will unearth these chapels, and will believe them to have been
houses, and to contain the <i>exuvi&aelig;</i> of the living
forms that tenanted them.&nbsp; In the meantime, however, let us
return to a consideration of the chapel as it may now be seen by
any one who cares to pass that way.</p>
<p>The work consists of about forty figures in all, not counting
Cupids, and is divided into four main divisions.&nbsp; First,
there is the large public sitting-room or drawing-room of the
College, where the elder young ladies are engaged in various
elegant employments.&nbsp; Three, at a table to the left, are
making a mitre for the Bishop, as may be seen from the model on
the table.&nbsp; Some are merely spinning or about to spin.&nbsp;
One young lady, sitting rather apart from the others, is doing an
elaborate piece of needlework at a tambour-frame near the window;
others are making lace or slippers, probably for the new curate;
another is struggling with a letter, or perhaps a theme, which
seems to be giving her a good deal of trouble, but which, when
done, will, I am sure, be beautiful.&nbsp; One dear little girl
is simply reading &ldquo;Paul and Virginia&rdquo; underneath the
window, and is so concealed that I hardly think she can be seen
from the outside at all, though from inside she is delightful; it
was with great regret that I could not get her into any
photograph.&nbsp; One most amiable young woman has got a
child&rsquo;s head on her lap, the child having played itself to
sleep.&nbsp; All are industriously and agreeably employed in some
way or other; all are plump; all are nice looking; there is not
one Becky Sharp in the whole school; on the contrary, as in
&ldquo;Pious Orgies,&rdquo; all is pious&mdash;or
sub-pious&mdash;and all, if not great, is at least eminently
respectable.&nbsp; One feels that St. Joachim and St. Anne could
not have chosen a school more judiciously, and that if one had
daughter oneself this is exactly where one would wish to place
her.&nbsp; If there is a fault of any kind in the arrangements,
it is that they do not keep cats enough.&nbsp; The place is
overrun with mice, though what these can find to eat I know
not.&nbsp; It occurs to me also that the young ladies might be
kept a little more free of spiders&rsquo; webs; but in all these
chapels, bats, mice and spiders are troublesome.</p>
<p>Off the main drawing-room on the side facing the window there
is a dais, which is approached by a large raised semicircular
step, higher than the rest of the floor, but lower than the dais
itself.&nbsp; The dais is, of course, reserved for the venerable
Lady Principal and the under-mistresses, one of whom, by the way,
is a little more <i>mondaine</i> than might have been expected,
and is admiring herself in a looking-glass&mdash;unless, indeed,
she is only looking to see if there is a spot of ink on her
face.&nbsp; The Lady Principal is seated near a table, on which
lie some books in expensive bindings, which I imagine to have
been presented to her by the parents of pupils who were leaving
school.&nbsp; One has given her a photographic album; another a
large scrap-book, for illustrations of all kinds; a third volume
has red edges, and is presumably of a devotional character.&nbsp;
If I dared venture another criticism, I should say it would be
better not to keep the ink-pot on the top of these books.&nbsp;
The Lady Principal is being read to by the monitress for the
week, whose duty it was to recite selected passages from the most
approved Hebrew writers; she appears to be a good deal outraged,
possibly at the faulty intonation of the reader, which she has
long tried vainly to correct; or perhaps she has been hearing of
the atrocious way in which her forefathers had treated the
prophets, and is explaining to the young ladies how impossible it
would be, in their own more enlightened age, for a prophet to
fail of recognition.</p>
<p>On the half-dais, as I suppose the large semicircular step
between the main room and the dais should be called, we find,
first, the monitress for the week, who stands up while she
recites; and secondly, the Virgin herself, who is the only pupil
allowed a seat so near to the august presence of the Lady
Principal.&nbsp; She is ostensibly doing a piece of embroidery
which is stretched on a cushion on her lap, but I should say that
she was chiefly interested in the nearest of four pretty little
Cupids, who are all trying to attract her attention, though they
pay no court to any other young lady.&nbsp; I have sometimes
wondered whether the obviously scandalised gesture of the Lady
Principal might not be directed at these Cupids, rather than at
anything the monitress may have been reading, for she would
surely find them disquieting.&nbsp; Or she may be saying,
&ldquo;Why, bless me!&nbsp; I do declare the Virgin has got
another hamper, and St. Anne&rsquo;s cakes are always so terribly
rich!&rdquo;&nbsp; Certainly the hamper is there, close to the
Virgin, and the Lady Principal&rsquo;s action may be well
directed at it, but it may have been sent to some other young
lady, and be put on the sub-dais for public exhibition.&nbsp; It
looks as if it might have come from Fortnum and Mason&rsquo;s,
and I half expected to find a label, addressing it to &ldquo;The
Virgin Mary, Temple College, Jerusalem,&rdquo; but if ever there
was one the mice have long since eaten it.&nbsp; The Virgin
herself does not seem to care much about it, but if she has a
fault it is that she is generally a little apathetic.</p>
<p>Whose the hamper was, however, is a point we shall never now
certainly determine, for the best fossil is worse than the worst
living form.&nbsp; Why, alas! was not Mr. Edison alive when this
chapel was made?&nbsp; We might then have had a daily
phonographic recital of the conversation, and an announcement
might be put outside the chapels, telling us at what hours the
figures would speak.</p>
<p>On either of side the main room there are two annexes opening
out from it; these are reserved chiefly for the younger children,
some of whom, I think, are little boys.&nbsp; In the left-hand
annex, behind the ladies who are making a mitre, there is a child
who has got a cake, and another has some fruit&mdash;possibly
given them by the Virgin&mdash;and a third child is begging for
some of it.&nbsp; The light failed so completely here that I was
not able to photograph any of these figures.&nbsp; It was a dull
September afternoon, and the clouds had settled thick round the
chapel, which is never very light, and is nearly 4000 feet above
the sea.&nbsp; I waited till such twilight as made it hopeless
that more detail could be got&mdash;and a queer ghostly place
enough it was to wait in&mdash;but after giving the plate an
exposure of fifty minutes, I saw I could get no more, and
desisted.</p>
<p>These long photographic exposures have the advantage that one
is compelled to study a work in detail through mere lack of other
employment, and that one can take one&rsquo;s notes in peace
without being tempted to hurry over them; but even so I
continually find I have omitted to note, and have clean
forgotten, much that I want later on.</p>
<p>In the other annex there are also one or two younger children,
but it seems to have been set apart for conversation and
relaxation more than any other part of the establishment.</p>
<p>I have already said that the work is signed by an inscription
inside the chapel, to the effect that the sculptures are by
Pietro Aureggio Termine di Biella.&nbsp; It will be seen that the
young ladies are exceedingly like one another, and that the
artist aimed at nothing more than a faithful rendering of the
life of his own times.&nbsp; Let us be thankful that he aimed at
nothing less.&nbsp; Perhaps his wife kept a girls&rsquo; school;
or he may have had a large family of fat, good-natured daughters,
whose little ways he had studied attentively; at all events the
work is full of spontaneous incident, and cannot fail to become
more and more interesting as the age it renders falls farther
back into the past.&nbsp; It is to be regretted that many
artists, better known men, have not been satisfied with the
humbler ambitions of this most amiable and interesting
sculptor.&nbsp; If he has left us no laboured life-studies, he
has at least done something for us which we can find nowhere
else, which we should be very sorry not to have, and the fidelity
of which to Italian life at the beginning of the last century
will not be disputed.</p>
<p>The eighth chapel is that of the <i>Sposalizio</i>, is
certainly not by Aureggio, and I should say was mainly by the
same sculptor who did the Presentation in the Temple.&nbsp; On
going inside I found the figures had come from more than one
source; some of them are constructed so absolutely on Valsesian
principles, as regards technique, that it may be assumed they
came from Varallo.&nbsp; Each of these last figures is in three
pieces, that are baked separately and cemented together
afterwards, hence they are more easily transported; no more clay
is used than is absolutely necessary; and the off-side of the
figure is neglected; they will be found chiefly, if not entirely,
at the top of the steps.&nbsp; The other figures are more solidly
built, and do not remind me in their business features of
anything in the Valsesia.&nbsp; There was a sculptor, Francesco
Sala, of Locarno (doubtless the village a short distance below
Varallo, and not the Locarno on the Lago Maggiore), who made
designs for some of the Oropa chapels, and some of whose letters
are still preserved, but whether the Valsesian figures in this
present work are by him or not I cannot say.</p>
<p>The statues are twenty-five in number; I could find no date or
signature; the work reminds me of Montrigone; several of the
figures are not at all bad, and several have horsehair for hair,
as at Varallo.&nbsp; The effect of the whole composition is
better than we have a right to expect from any sculpture dating
from the beginning of the last century.</p>
<p>The ninth chapel, the Annunciation, presents no feature of
interest; nor yet does the tenth, the Visit of Mary to
Elizabeth.&nbsp; The eleventh, the Nativity, though rather
better, is still not remarkable.</p>
<p>The twelfth, the Purification, is absurdly bad, but I do not
know whether the expression of strong personal dislike to the
Virgin which the High Priest wears is intended as prophetic, or
whether it is the result of incompetence, or whether it is merely
a smile gone wrong in the baking.&nbsp; It is amusing to find
Marocco, who has not been strict about arch&aelig;ological
accuracy hitherto, complain here that there is an anachronism,
inasmuch as some young ecclesiastics are dressed as they would be
at present, and one of them actually carries a wax candle.&nbsp;
This is not as it should be; in works like those at Oropa, where
implicit reliance is justly placed on the earnest endeavours that
have been so successfully made to thoroughly and carefully and
patiently ensure the accuracy of the minutest details, it is a
pity that even a single error should have escaped detection;
this, however, has most unfortunately happened here, and Marocco
feels it his duty to put us on our guard.&nbsp; He explains that
the mistake arose from the sculptor&rsquo;s having taken both his
general arrangement and his details from some picture of the
fourteenth or fifteenth century, when the value of the strictest
historical accuracy was not yet so fully understood.</p>
<p>It seems to me that in the matter of accuracy, priests and men
of science whether lay or regular on the one hand, and plain
people whether lay or regular on the other, are trying to play a
different game, and fail to understand one another because they
do not see that their objects are not the same.&nbsp; The cleric
and the man of science (who is only the cleric in his latest
development) are trying to develop a throat with two distinct
passages&mdash;one that shall refuse to pass even the smallest
gnat, and another that shall gracefully gulp even the largest
camel; whereas we men of the street desire but one throat, and
are content that this shall swallow nothing bigger than a
pony.&nbsp; Every one knows that there is no such effectual means
of developing the power to swallow camels as incessant
watchfulness for opportunities of straining at gnats, and this
should explain many passages that puzzle us in the work both of
our clerics and our scientists.&nbsp; I, not being a man of
science, still continue to do what I said I did in &ldquo;Alps
and Sanctuaries,&rdquo; and make it a rule to earnestly and
patiently and carefully swallow a few of the smallest gnats I can
find several times a day, as the best astringent for the throat I
know of.</p>
<p>The thirteenth chapel is the Marriage Feast at Cana of
Galilee.&nbsp; This is the best chapel as a work of art; indeed,
it is the only one which can claim to be taken quite
seriously.&nbsp; Not that all the figures are very good; those to
the left of the composition are commonplace enough; nor are the
Christ and the giver of the feast at all remarkable; but the ten
or dozen figures of guests and attendants at the right-hand end
of the work are as good as anything of their kind can be, and
remind me so strongly of Tabachetti that I cannot doubt they were
done by some one who was indirectly influenced by that great
sculptor&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; It is not likely that Tabachetti was
alive long after 1640, by which time he would have been about
eighty years old; and the foundations of this chapel were not
laid till about 1690; the statues are probably a few years later;
they can hardly, therefore, be by one who had even studied under
Tabachetti; but until I found out the dates, and went inside the
chapel to see the way in which the figures had been constructed,
I was inclined to think they might be by Tabachetti himself, of
whom, indeed, they are not unworthy.&nbsp; On examining the
figures I found them more heavily constructed than
Tabachetti&rsquo;s are, with smaller holes for taking out
superfluous clay, and more finished on the off-sides.&nbsp;
Marocco says the sculptor is not known.&nbsp; I looked in vain
for any date or signature.&nbsp; Possibly the right-hand figures
(for the left-hand ones can hardly be by the same hand) may be by
some sculptor from Crea, which is at no very great distance from
Oropa, who was penetrated by Tabachetti&rsquo;s influence; but
whether as regards action and concert with one another, or as
regards excellence in detail, I do not see how anything can be
more realistic, and yet more harmoniously composed.&nbsp; The
placing of the musicians in a minstrels&rsquo; gallery helps the
effect; these musicians are six in number, and the other figures
are twenty-three.&nbsp; Under the table, between Christ and the
giver of the feast, there is a cat.</p>
<p>The fourteenth chapel, the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, is
without interest.</p>
<p>The fifteenth, the Coronation of the Virgin, contains
forty-six angels, twenty-six cherubs, fifty-six saints, the Holy
Trinity, the Madonna herself, and twenty-four innocents, making
156 statues in all.&nbsp; Of these I am afraid there is not one
of more than ordinary merit; the most interesting is a
half-length nude life-study of Disma&mdash;the good thief.&nbsp;
After what had been promised him it was impossible to exclude
him, but it was felt that a half-length nude figure would be as
much as he could reasonably expect.</p>
<p>Behind the sanctuary there is a semi-ruinous and wholly
valueless work, which shows the finding of the black image, which
is now in the church, but is only shown on great festivals.</p>
<p>This leads us to a consideration that I have delayed till
now.&nbsp; The black image is the central feature of Oropa; it is
the <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> of the whole place, and all
else is a mere incrustation, so to speak, around it.&nbsp;
According to this image, then, which was carved by St. Luke
himself, and than which nothing can be better authenticated, both
the Madonna and the infant Christ were as black as anything can
be conceived.&nbsp; It is not likely that they were as black as
they have been painted; no one yet ever was so black as that;
yet, even allowing for some exaggeration on St. Luke&rsquo;s
part, they must have been exceedingly black if the portrait is to
be accepted; and uncompromisingly black they accordingly are on
most of the wayside chapels for many a mile around Oropa.&nbsp;
Yet in the chapels we have been hitherto considering&mdash;works
in which, as we know, the most punctilious regard has been shown
to accuracy&mdash;both the Virgin and Christ are uncompromisingly
white.&nbsp; As in the shops under the Colonnade where devotional
knick-knacks are sold, you can buy a black china image or a white
one, whichever you like; so with the pictures&mdash;the black and
white are placed side by side&mdash;<i>pagando il danaro si
pu&ograve; scegliere</i>.&nbsp; It rests not with history or with
the Church to say whether the Madonna and Child were black or
white, but you may settle it for yourself, whichever way you
please, or rather you are required, with the acquiescence of the
Church, to hold that they were both black and white at one and
the same time.</p>
<p>It cannot be maintained that the Church leaves the matter
undecided, and by tolerating both types proclaims the question an
open one, for she acquiesces in the portrait by St. Luke as
genuine.&nbsp; How, then, justify the whiteness of the Holy
Family in the chapels?&nbsp; If the portrait is not known as
genuine, why set such a stumbling-block in our paths as to show
us a black Madonna and a white one, both as historically
accurate, within a few yards of one another?</p>
<p>I ask this not in mockery, but as knowing that the Church must
have an explanation to give, if she would only give it, and as
myself unable to find any, even the most farfetched, that can
bring what we see at Oropa, Loreto and elsewhere into harmony
with modern conscience, either intellectual or ethical.</p>
<p>I see, indeed, from an interesting article in the <i>Atlantic
Monthly</i> for September 1889, entitled &ldquo;The Black Madonna
of Loreto,&rdquo; that black Madonnas were so frequent in ancient
Christian art that &ldquo;some of the early writers of the Church
felt obliged to account for it by explaining that the Virgin was
of a very dark complexion, as might be proved by the verse of
Canticles which says, &lsquo;I am black, but comely, O ye
daughters of Jerusalem.&rsquo;&nbsp; Others maintained that she
became black during her sojourn in Egypt. . . .&nbsp; Priests, of
to-day, say that extreme age and exposure to the smoke of
countless altar-candles have caused that change in complexion
which the more na&iuml;ve fathers of the Church attributed to the
power of an Egyptian sun&rdquo;; but the writer ruthlessly
disposes of this supposition by pointing out that in nearly all
the instances of black Madonnas it is the flesh alone that is
entirely black, the crimson of the lips, the white of the eyes,
and the draperies having preserved their original colour.&nbsp;
The authoress of the article (Mrs. Hilliard) goes on to tell us
that Pausanias mentions two statues of the black Venus, and says
that the oldest statue of Ceres among the Phigalenses was
black.&nbsp; She adds that Minerva Aglaurus, the daughter of
Cecrops, at Athens, was black; that Corinth had a black Venus, as
also the Thespians; that the oracles of Dodona and Delphi were
founded by black doves, the emissaries of Venus, and that the
Isis Multimammia in the Capitol at Rome is black.</p>
<p>Sometimes I have asked myself whether the Church does not
intend to suggest that the whole story falls outside the domain
of history, and is to be held as the one great epos, or myth,
common to all mankind; adaptable by each nation according to its
own several needs; translatable, so to speak, into the facts of
each individual nation, as the written word is translatable into
its language, but appertaining to the realm of the imagination
rather than to that of the understanding, and precious for
spiritual rather than literal truths.&nbsp; More briefly, I have
wondered whether she may not intend that such details as whether
the Virgin was white or black are of very little importance in
comparison with the basing of ethics on a story that shall appeal
to black races as well as to white ones.</p>
<p>If so, it is time we were made to understand this more
clearly.&nbsp; If the Church, whether of Rome or England, would
lean to some such view as this&mdash;tainted though it be with
mysticism&mdash;if we could see either great branch of the Church
make a frank, authoritative attempt to bring its teaching into
greater harmony with the educated understanding and conscience of
the time, instead of trying to fetter that understanding with
bonds that gall it daily more and more profoundly; then I, for
one, in view of the difficulty and graciousness of the task, and
in view of the great importance of historical continuity, would
gladly sink much of my own private opinion as to the value of the
Christian ideal, and would gratefully help either Church or both,
according to the best of my very feeble ability.&nbsp; On these
terms, indeed, I could swallow not a few camels myself cheerfully
enough.</p>
<p>Can we, however, see any signs as though either Rome or
England will stir hand or foot to meet us?&nbsp; Can any step be
pointed to as though either Church wished to make things easier
for men holding the opinions held by the late Mr. Darwin, or by
Mr. Herbert Spencer and Professor Huxley?&nbsp; How can those who
accept evolution with any thoroughness accept such doctrines as
the Incarnation or the Redemption with any but a
quasi-allegorical and poetical interpretation?&nbsp; Can we
conceivably accept these doctrines in the literal sense in which
the Church advances them?&nbsp; And can the leaders of the Church
be blind to the resistlessness of the current that has set
against those literal interpretations which she seems to hug more
and more closely the more religious life is awakened at
all?&nbsp; The clergyman is wanted as supplementing the doctor
and the lawyer in all civilised communities; these three keep
watch on one another, and prevent one another from becoming too
powerful.&nbsp; I, who distrust the <i>doctrinaire</i> in science
even more than the <i>doctrinaire</i> in religion, should view
with dismay the abolition of the Church of England, as knowing
that a blatant bastard science would instantly step into her
shoes; but if some such deplorable consummation is to be avoided
in England, it can only be through more evident leaning on the
part of our clergy to such an interpretation of the Sacred
History as the presence of a black and white Madonna almost side
by side at Oropa appears to suggest.</p>
<p>I fear that in these last paragraphs I may have trenched on
dangerous ground, but it is not possible to go to such places as
Oropa without asking oneself what they mean and involve.&nbsp; As
for the average Italian pilgrims, they do not appear to give the
matter so much as a thought.&nbsp; They love Oropa, and flock to
it in thousands during the summer; the President of the
Administration assured me that they lodged, after a fashion, as
many as ten thousand pilgrims on the 15th of last August.&nbsp;
It is astonishing how living the statues are to these people, and
how the wicked are upbraided and the good applauded.&nbsp; At
Varallo, since I took the photographs I published in my book
&ldquo;Ex Voto,&rdquo; an angry pilgrim has smashed the nose of
the dwarf in Tabachetti&rsquo;s Journey to Calvary, for no other
reason than inability to restrain his indignation against one who
was helping to inflict pain on Christ.&nbsp; It is the real hair
and the painting up to nature that does this.&nbsp; Here at Oropa
I found a paper on the floor of the <i>Sposalizio</i> Chapel,
which ran as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the grace of God and the will of the administrative
chapter of this sanctuary, there have come here to work --- ---,
mason --- ---, carpenter, and --- --- plumber, all of Chiavazza,
on the twenty-first day of January 1886, full of cold (<i>pieni
di freddo</i>).</p>
<p>&ldquo;They write these two lines to record their visit.&nbsp;
They pray the Blessed Virgin that she will maintain them safe and
sound from everything equivocal that may befall them (<i>sempre
sani e salvi da ogni equivoco li possa accadere</i>).&nbsp; Oh,
farewell!&nbsp; We reverently salute all the present statues, and
especially the Blessed Virgin, and the reader.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the <i>Universal Review</i>, I suppose, all its
readers are to consider themselves saluted; at any rate, these
good fellows, in the effusiveness of their hearts, actually wrote
the above in pencil.&nbsp; I was sorely tempted to steal it, but,
after copying it, left it in the Chief Priest&rsquo;s hands
instead.</p>
<h2>ART IN THE VALLEY OF SAAS <a name="citation11"></a><a
href="#footnote11" class="citation">[11]</a></h2>
<p>Having been told by Mr. Fortescue, of the British Museum, that
there were some chapels at Saas-F&eacute;e which bore analogy to
those at Varallo, described in my book &ldquo;Ex Voto,&rdquo; <a
name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12"
class="citation">[12]</a> I went to Saas during this last summer,
and venture now to lay my conclusions before the reader.</p>
<p>The chapels are fifteen in number, and lead up to a larger and
singularly graceful one, rather more than half-way between Saas
and Saas-F&eacute;e.&nbsp; This is commonly but wrongly called
the chapel of St. Joseph, for it is dedicated to the Virgin, and
its situation is of such extreme beauty&mdash;the great
F&eacute;e glaciers showing through the open portico&mdash;that
it is in itself worth a pilgrimage.&nbsp; It is surrounded by
noble larches and overhung by rock; in front of the portico there
is a small open space covered with grass, and a huge larch, the
stem of which is girt by a rude stone seat.&nbsp; The portico
itself contains seats for worshippers, and a pulpit from which
the preacher&rsquo;s voice can reach the many who must stand
outside.&nbsp; The walls of the inner chapel are hung with votive
pictures, some of them very quaint and pleasing, and not
overweighted by those qualities that are usually dubbed by the
name of artistic merit.&nbsp; Innumerable wooden and waxen
representations of arms, legs, eyes, ears and babies tell of the
cures that have been effected during two centuries of devotion,
and can hardly fail to awaken a kindly sympathy with the long
dead and forgotten folks who placed them where they are.</p>
<p>The main interest, however, despite the extreme loveliness of
the St. Mary&rsquo;s Chapel, centres rather in the small and
outwardly unimportant oratories (if they should be so called)
that lead up to it.&nbsp; These begin immediately with the ascent
from the level ground on which the village of Saas-im-Grund is
placed, and contain scenes in the history of the Redemption,
represented by rude but spirited wooden figures, each about two
feet high, painted, gilt, and rendered as life-like in all
respects as circumstances would permit.&nbsp; The figures have
suffered a good deal from neglect, and are still not a little
misplaced.&nbsp; With the assistance, however, of the Rev. E. J.
Selwyn, English Chaplain at Saas-im-Grund, I have been able to
replace many of them in their original positions, as indicated by
the parts of the figures that are left rough-hewn and
unpainted.&nbsp; They vary a good deal in interest, and can be
easily sneered at by those who make a trade of sneering.&nbsp;
Those, on the other hand, who remain unsophisticated by overmuch
art-culture will find them full of character in spite of not a
little rudeness of execution, and will be surprised at coming
across such works in a place so remote from any art-centre as
Saas must have been at the time these chapels were made.&nbsp; It
will be my business therefore to throw what light I can upon the
questions how they came to be made at all, and who was the artist
who designed them.</p>
<p>The only documentary evidence consists in a chronicle of the
valley of Saas written in the early years of this century by the
Rev. Peter Jos. Ruppen, and published at Sion in 1851.&nbsp; This
work makes frequent reference to a manuscript by the Rev. Peter
Joseph Clemens Lommatter, <i>cur&eacute;</i> of Saas-F&eacute;e
from 1738 to 1751, which has unfortunately been lost, so that we
have no means of knowing how closely it was adhered to.&nbsp; The
Rev. Jos. Ant. Ruppen, the present excellent <i>cur&eacute;</i>
of Saas-im-Grund, assures me that there is no reference to the
Saas-F&eacute;e oratories in the &ldquo;Actes de
l&rsquo;Eglise&rdquo; at Saas, which I understand go a long way
back; but I have not seen these myself.&nbsp; Practically, then,
we have no more documentary evidence than is to be found in the
published chronicle above referred to.</p>
<p>We there find it stated that the large chapel, commonly, but
as above explained, wrongly called St. Joseph&rsquo;s, was built
in 1687, and enlarged by subscription in 1747.&nbsp; These dates
appear on the building itself, and are no doubt accurate.&nbsp;
The writer adds that there was no actual edifice on this site
before the one now existing was built, but there was a miraculous
picture of the Virgin placed in a mural niche, before which the
pious herdsmen and devout inhabitants of the valley worshipped
under the vault of heaven. <a name="citation13"></a><a
href="#footnote13" class="citation">[13]</a>&nbsp; A miraculous
(or miracle-working) picture was always more or less rare and
important; the present site, therefore, seems to have been long
one of peculiar sanctity.&nbsp; Possibly the name F&eacute;e may
point to still earlier Pagan mysteries on the same site.</p>
<p>As regards the fifteen small chapels, the writer says they
illustrate the fifteen mysteries of the Psalter, and were built
in 1709, each householder of the Saas-F&eacute;e contributing one
chapel.&nbsp; He adds that Heinrich Andenmatten, afterwards a
brother of the Society of Jesus, was an especial benefactor or
promoter of the undertaking.&nbsp; One of the chapels, the
Ascension (No. 12 of the series), has the date 1709 painted on
it; but there is no date on any other chapel, and there seems no
reason why this should be taken as governing the whole
series.</p>
<p>Over and above this, there exists in Saas a tradition, as I
was told immediately on my arrival, by an English visitor, that
the chapels were built in consequence of a flood, but I have
vainly endeavoured to trace this story to an indigenous
source.</p>
<p>The internal evidence of the wooden figures
themselves&mdash;nothing analogous to which, it should be
remembered, can be found in the chapel of 1687&mdash;points to a
much earlier date.&nbsp; I have met with no school of sculpture
belonging to the early part of the eighteenth century to which
they can be plausibly assigned; and the supposition that they are
the work of some unknown local genius who was not led up to and
left no successors may be dismissed, for the work is too
scholarly to have come from any one but a trained sculptor.&nbsp;
I refer of course to those figures which the artist must be
supposed to have executed with his own hand, as, for example, the
central figure of the Crucifixion group and those of the
Magdalene and St. John.&nbsp; The greater number of the figures
were probably, as was suggested to me by Mr. Ranshaw, of Lowth,
executed by a local woodcarver from models in clay and wax
furnished by the artist himself.&nbsp; Those who examine the play
of line in the hair, mantle, and sleeve of the Magdalene in the
Crucifixion group, and contrast it with the greater part of the
remaining draperies, will find little hesitation in concluding
that this was the case, and will ere long readily distinguish the
two hands from which the figures have mainly come.&nbsp; I say
&ldquo;mainly,&rdquo; because there is at least one other
sculptor who may well have belonged to the year 1709, but who
fortunately has left us little.&nbsp; Examples of his work may
perhaps be seen in the nearest villain with a big hat in the
Flagellation chapel, and in two cherubs in the Assumption of the
Virgin.</p>
<p>We may say, then, with some certainty, that the designer was a
cultivated and practised artist.&nbsp; We may also not less
certainly conclude that he was of Flemish origin, for the horses
in the Journey to Calvary and Crucifixion chapels, where alone
there are any horses at all, are of Flemish breed, with no trace
of the Arab blood adopted by Gaudenzio at Varallo.&nbsp; The
character, moreover, of the villains is Northern&mdash;of the
Quentin Matsys, Martin Schongauer type, rather than Italian; the
same sub-Rubensesque feeling which is apparent in more than one
chapel at Varallo is not less evident here&mdash;especially in
the Journey to Calvary and Crucifixion chapels.&nbsp; There can
hardly, therefore, be a doubt that the artist was a Fleming who
had worked for several years in Italy.</p>
<p>It is also evident that he had Tabachetti&rsquo;s work at
Varallo well in his mind.&nbsp; For not only does he adopt
certain details of costume (I refer particularly to the treatment
of soldiers&rsquo; tunics) which are peculiar to Tabachetti at
Varallo, but whenever he treats a subject which Tabachetti had
treated at Varallo, as in the Flagellation, Crowning with Thorns,
and Journey to Calvary chapels, the work at Saas is evidently
nothing but a somewhat modified abridgement of that at
Varallo.&nbsp; When, however, as in the Annunciation, the
Nativity, the Crucifixion, and other chapels, the work at Varallo
is by another than Tabachetti, no allusion is made to it.&nbsp;
The Saas artist has Tabachetti&rsquo;s Varallo work at his
finger-ends, but betrays no acquaintance whatever with Gaudenzio
Ferrari, Gio. Ant. Paracca, or Giovanni D&rsquo;Enrico.</p>
<p>Even, moreover, when Tabachetti&rsquo;s work at Varallo is
being most obviously drawn from, as in the Journey to Calvary
chapel, the Saas version differs materially from that at Varallo,
and is in some respects an improvement on it.&nbsp; The idea of
showing other horsemen and followers coming up from behind, whose
heads can be seen over the crown of the interposing hill, is
singularly effective as suggesting a number of others that are
unseen, nor can I conceive that any one but the original designer
would follow Tabachetti&rsquo;s Varallo design with as much
closeness as it has been followed here, and yet make such a
brilliantly successful modification.&nbsp; The stumbling, again,
of one horse (a detail almost hidden, according to
Tabachetti&rsquo;s wont) is a touch which Tabachetti himself
might add, but which no Saas woodcarver who was merely adapting
from a reminiscence of Tabachetti&rsquo;s Varallo chapel would be
likely to introduce.&nbsp; These considerations have convinced me
that the designer of the chapels at Saas is none other than
Tabachetti himself, who, as has been now conclusively shown, was
a native of Dinant, in Belgium.</p>
<p>The Saas chronicler, indeed, avers that the chapels were not
built till 1709&mdash;a statement apparently corroborated by a
date now visible on one chapel; but we must remember that the
chronicler did not write until a century or so later than 1709,
and though, indeed, his statement may have been taken from the
lost earlier manuscript of 1738, we know nothing about this
either one way or the other.&nbsp; The writer may have gone by
the still existing 1709 on the Ascension chapel, whereas this
date may in fact have referred to a restoration, and not to an
original construction.&nbsp; There is nothing, as I have said, in
the choice of the chapel on which the date appears, to suggest
that it was intended to govern the others.&nbsp; I have explained
that the work is isolated and exotic.&nbsp; It is by one in whom
Flemish and Italian influences are alike equally predominant; by
one who was saturated with Tabachetti&rsquo;s Varallo work, and
who can improve upon it, but over whom the other Varallo
sculptors have no power.&nbsp; The style of the work is of the
sixteenth and not of the eighteenth century&mdash;with a few
obvious exceptions that suit the year 1709 exceedingly
well.&nbsp; Against such considerations as these, a statement
made at the beginning of this century referring to a century
earlier, and a promiscuous date upon one chapel, can carry but
little weight.&nbsp; I shall assume, therefore, henceforward,
that we have here groups designed in a plastic material by
Tabachetti, and reproduced in wood by the best local
wood-sculptor available, with the exception of a few figures cut
by the artist himself.</p>
<p>We ask, then, at what period in his life did Tabachetti design
these chapels, and what led to his coming to such an
out-of-the-way place as Saas at all?&nbsp; We should remember
that, according both to Fassola and Torrotti (writing in 1671 and
1686 respectively), Tabachetti <a name="citation14"></a><a
href="#footnote14" class="citation">[14]</a> became insane about
the year 1586 or early in 1587, after having just begun the
Salutation chapel.&nbsp; I have explained in &ldquo;Ex
Voto&rdquo; that I do not believe this story.&nbsp; I have no
doubt that Tabachetti was declared to be mad, but I believe this
to have been due to an intrigue, set on foot in order to get a
foreign artist out of the way, and to secure the Massacre of the
Innocents chapel, at that precise time undertaken, for Gio. Ant.
Paracca, who was an Italian.</p>
<p>Or he may have been sacrificed in order to facilitate the
return of the workers in stucco whom he had superseded on the
Sacro Monte.&nbsp; He may have been goaded into some imprudence
which was seized upon as a pretext for shutting him up; at any
rate, the fact that when in 1587 he inherited his father&rsquo;s
property at Dinant, his trustee (he being expressly stated to be
&ldquo;<i>expatri&eacute;</i>&rdquo;) was
&ldquo;<i>datif</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>dativus</i>,&rdquo;
appointed not by himself but by the court, lends colour to the
statement that he was not his own master at the time; for in
later kindred deeds, now at Namur, he appoints his own
trustee.&nbsp; I suppose, then, that Tabachetti was shut up in a
madhouse at Varallo for a considerable time, during which I can
find no trace of him, but that eventually he escaped or was
released.</p>
<p>Whether he was a fugitive, or whether he was let out from
prison, he would in either case, in all reasonable probability,
turn his face homeward.&nbsp; If he was escaping, he would make
immediately for the Savoy frontier, within which Saas then
lay.&nbsp; He would cross the Baranca above Fobello, coming down
on to Ponte Grande in the Val Anzasca.&nbsp; He would go up the
Val Anzasca to Macugnaga, and over the Monte Moro, which would
bring him immediately to Saas.&nbsp; Saas, therefore, is the
nearest and most natural place for him to make for, if he were
flying from Varallo, and here I suppose him to have halted.</p>
<p>It so happened that on the 9th of September, 1589, there was
one of the three great outbreaks of the Mattmark See that have
from time to time devastated the valley of Saas. <a
name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15"
class="citation">[15]</a>&nbsp; It is probable that the chapels
were decided upon in consequence of some grace shown by the
miraculous picture of the Virgin, which had mitigated a disaster
occurring so soon after the anniversary of her own
Nativity.&nbsp; Tabachetti, arriving at this juncture, may have
offered to undertake them if the Saas people would give him an
asylum.&nbsp; Here, at any rate, I suppose him to have stayed
till some time in 1590, probably the second half of it, his
design of eventually returning home, if he ever entertained it,
being then interrupted by a summons to Crea near Casale, where I
believe him to have worked with a few brief interruptions
thenceforward for little if at all short of half a century, or
until about the year 1640.&nbsp; I admit, however, that the
evidence for assigning him so long a life rests solely on the
supposed identity of the figure known as &ldquo;Il
Vecchietto,&rdquo; in the Varallo Descent from the Cross chapel,
with the portrait of Tabachetti himself in the Ecce Homo chapel,
also at Varallo.</p>
<p>I find additional reason for thinking the chapels owe their
origin to the inundation of September 9, 1589, in the fact that
the 8th of September is made a day of pilgrimage to the
Saas-F&eacute;e chapels throughout the whole valley of
Saas.&nbsp; It is true the 8th of September is the festival of
the Nativity of the Virgin Mary, so that under any circumstances
this would be a great day, but the fact that not only the people
of Saas, but the whole valley down to Visp, flock to this chapel
on the 8th of September, points to the belief that some special
act of grace on the part of the Virgin was vouchsafed on this day
in connection with this chapel.&nbsp; A belief that it was owing
to the intervention of St. Mary of F&eacute;e that the inundation
was not attended with loss of life would be very likely to lead
to the foundation of a series of chapels leading up to the place
where her miraculous picture was placed, and to the more special
celebration of her Nativity in connection with this spot
throughout the valley of Saas.&nbsp; I have discussed the subject
with the Rev. Jos. Ant. Ruppen, and he told me he thought the
fact that the great <i>f&ecirc;te</i> of the year in connection
with the Saas-F&eacute;e chapels was on the 8th of September
pointed rather strongly to the supposition that there was a
connection between these and the recorded flood of September 9,
1589.</p>
<p>Turning to the individual chapels they are as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The Annunciation.&nbsp; The treatment here presents
no more analogy to that of the same subject at Varallo than is
inevitable in the nature of the subject.&nbsp; The Annunciation
figures at Varallo have proved to be mere draped dummies with
wooden heads; Tabachetti, even though he did the heads, which he
very likely did, would take no interest in the Varallo work with
the same subject.&nbsp; The Annunciation, from its very
simplicity as well as from the transcendental nature of the
subject, is singularly hard to treat, and the work here, whatever
it may once have been, is now no longer remarkable.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The Salutation of Mary by Elizabeth.&nbsp; This
group, again, bears no analogy to the Salutation chapel at
Varallo, in which Tabachetti&rsquo;s share was so small that it
cannot be considered as in any way his.&nbsp; It is not to be
expected, therefore, that the Saas chapel should follow the
Varallo one.&nbsp; The figures, four in number, are pleasing and
well arranged.&nbsp; St. Joseph, St. Elizabeth, and St. Zacharias
are all talking at once.&nbsp; The Virgin is alone silent.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The Nativity is much damaged and hard to see.&nbsp;
The treatment bears no analogy to that adopted by Gaudenzio
Ferrari at Varallo.&nbsp; There is one pleasing young shepherd
standing against the wall, but some figures have no doubt (as in
others of the chapels) disappeared, and those that remain have
been so shifted from their original positions that very little
idea can be formed of what the group was like when Tabachetti
left it.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; The Purification.&nbsp; I can hardly say why this
chapel should remind me, as it does, of the Circumcision chapel
at Varallo, for there are more figures here than space at Varallo
will allow.&nbsp; It cannot be pretended that any single figure
is of extraordinary merit, but amongst them they tell their story
with excellent effect.&nbsp; Two, those of St. Joseph and St.
Anna (?), that doubtless were once more important factors in the
drama, are now so much in corners near the window that they can
hardly be seen.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The Dispute in the Temple.&nbsp; This subject is not
treated at Varallo.&nbsp; Here at Saas there are only six doctors
now; whether or no there were originally more cannot be
determined.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; The Agony in the Garden.&nbsp; Tabachetti had no
chapel with this subject at Varallo, and there is no resemblance
between the Saas chapel and that by D&rsquo;Enrico.&nbsp; The
figures are no doubt approximately in their original positions,
but I have no confidence that I have rearranged them
correctly.&nbsp; They were in such confusion when I first saw
them that the Rev. E. J. Selwyn and myself determined to
rearrange them.&nbsp; They have doubtless been shifted more than
once since Tabachetti left them.&nbsp; The sleeping figures are
all good.&nbsp; St. James is perhaps a little prosaic.&nbsp; One
Roman soldier who is coming into the garden with a lantern, and
motioning silence with his hand, does duty for the others that
are to follow him.&nbsp; I should think more than one of these
figures is actually carved in wood by Tabachetti, allowance being
made for the fact that he was working in a material with which he
was not familiar, and which no sculptor of the highest rank has
ever found congenial.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; The Flagellation.&nbsp; Tabachetti has a chapel with
this subject at Varallo, and the Saas group is obviously a
descent with modification from his work there.&nbsp; The figure
of Christ is so like the one at Varallo that I think it must have
been carved by Tabachetti himself.&nbsp; The man with the hooked
nose, who at Varallo is stooping to bind his rods, is here
upright: it was probably the intention to emphasise him in the
succeeding scenes as well as this, in the same way as he has been
emphasised at Varallo, but his nose got pared down in the cutting
of later scenes, and could not easily be added to.&nbsp; The man
binding Christ to the column at Varallo is repeated (<i>longo
intervallo</i>) here, and the whole work is one inspired by that
at Varallo, though no single figure except that of the Christ is
adhered to with any very great closeness.&nbsp; I think the
nearer malefactor, with a goitre, and wearing a large black hat,
is either an addition of the year 1709, or was done by the
journeyman of the local sculptor who carved the greater number of
the figures.&nbsp; The man stooping down to bind his rods can
hardly be by the same hand as either of the two black-hatted
malefactors, but it is impossible to speak with certainty.&nbsp;
The general effect of the chapel is excellent, if we consider the
material in which it is executed, and the rudeness of the
audience to whom it addresses itself.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; The Crowning with Thorns.&nbsp; Here again the
inspiration is derived from Tabachetti&rsquo;s Crowning with
Thorns at Varallo.&nbsp; The Christs in the two chapels are
strikingly alike, and the general effect is that of a residuary
impression left in the mind of one who had known the Varallo
Flagellation exceedingly well.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; Sta. Veronica.&nbsp; This and the next succeeding
chapels are the most important of the series.&nbsp;
Tabachetti&rsquo;s Journey to Calvary at Varallo is again the
source from which the present work was taken, but, as I have
already said, it has been modified in reproduction.&nbsp; Mount
Calvary is still shown, as at Varallo, towards the left-hand
corner of the work, but at Saas it is more towards the middle
than at Varallo, so that horsemen and soldiers may be seen coming
up behind it&mdash;a stroke that deserves the name of genius none
the less for the manifest imperfection with which it has been
carried into execution.&nbsp; There are only three horses fully
shown, and one partly shown.&nbsp; They are all of the heavy
Flemish type adopted by Tabachetti at Varallo.&nbsp; The man
kicking the fallen Christ and the goitred man (with the same
teeth missing), who are so conspicuous in the Varallo Journey to
Calvary, reappear here, only the kicking man has much less nose
than at Varallo, probably because (as explained) the nose got
whittled away and could not be whittled back again.&nbsp; I
observe that the kind of lapelled tunic which Tabachetti, and
only Tabachetti, adopts at Varallo, is adopted for the centurion
in this chapel, and indeed throughout the Saas chapels this
particular form of tunic is the most usual for a Roman
soldier.&nbsp; The work is still a very striking one,
notwithstanding its translation into wood and the decay into
which it has been allowed to fall; nor can it fail to impress the
visitor who is familiar with this class of art as coming from a
man of extraordinary dramatic power and command over the almost
impossible art of composing many figures together effectively in
all-round sculpture.&nbsp; Whether all the figures are even now
as Tabachetti left them I cannot determine, but Mr. Selwyn has
restored Simon the Cyrenian to the position in which he obviously
ought to stand, and between us we have got the chapel into
something more like order.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; The Crucifixion.&nbsp; This subject was treated at
Varallo not by Tabachetti but by Gaudenzio Ferrari.&nbsp; It
confirms therefore my opinion as to the designer of the Saas
chapels to find in them no trace of the Varallo Crucifixion,
while the kind of tunic which at Varallo is only found in chapels
wherein Tabachetti worked again appears here.&nbsp; The work is
in a deplorable state of decay.&nbsp; Mr. Selwyn has greatly
improved the arrangement of the figures, but even now they are
not, I imagine, quite as Tabachetti left them.&nbsp; The figure
of Christ is greatly better in technical execution than that of
either of the two thieves; the folds of the drapery alone will
show this even to an unpractised eye.&nbsp; I do not think there
can be a doubt but that Tabachetti cut this figure himself, as
also those of the Magdalene and St. John, who stand at the foot
of the cross.&nbsp; The thieves are coarsely executed, with no
very obvious distinction between the penitent and the impenitent
one, except that there is a fiend painted on the ceiling over the
impenitent thief.&nbsp; The one horse introduced into the
composition is again of the heavy Flemish type adopted by
Tabachetti at Varallo.&nbsp; There is great difference in the
care with which the folds on the several draperies have been cut,
some being stiff and poor enough, while others are done very
sufficiently.&nbsp; In spite of smallness of scale, ignoble
material, disarrangement and decay, the work is still
striking.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; The Resurrection.&nbsp; There being no chapel at
Varallo with any of the remaining subjects treated at Saas, the
sculptor has struck out a line for himself.&nbsp; The Christ in
the Resurrection Chapel is a carefully modelled figure, and if
better painted might not be ineffective.&nbsp; Three soldiers,
one sleeping, alone remain.&nbsp; There were probably other
figures that have been lost.&nbsp; The sleeping soldier is very
pleasing.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; The Ascension is not remarkably interesting; the
Christ appears to be, but perhaps is not, a much more modern
figure than the rest.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp; The Descent of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; Some of the
figures along the end wall are very good, and were, I should
imagine, cut by Tabachetti himself.&nbsp; Those against the two
side walls are not so well cut.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; The Assumption of the Virgin Mary.&nbsp; The two
large cherubs here are obviously by a later hand, and the small
ones are not good.&nbsp; The figure of the Virgin herself is
unexceptionable.&nbsp; There were doubtless once other figures of
the Apostles which have disappeared; of these a single St. Peter
(?), so hidden away in a corner near the window that it can only
be seen with difficulty, is the sole survivor.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp; The Coronation of the Virgin is of later date, and
has probably superseded an earlier work.&nbsp; It can hardly be
by the designer of the other chapels of the series.&nbsp; Perhaps
Tabachetti had to leave for Crea before all the chapels at Saas
were finished.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have the larger chapel dedicated to St. Mary, which
crowns the series.&nbsp; Here there is nothing of more than
common artistic interest, unless we except the stone altar
mentioned in Ruppen&rsquo;s chronicle.&nbsp; This is of course
classical in style, and is, I should think, very good.</p>
<p>Once more I must caution the reader against expecting to find
highly-finished gems of art in the chapels I have been
describing.&nbsp; A wooden figure not more than two feet high
clogged with many coats of paint can hardly claim to be taken
very seriously, and even those few that were cut by Tabachetti
himself were not meant to have attention concentrated on
themselves alone.&nbsp; As mere wood-carving the Saas-F&eacute;e
chapels will not stand comparison, for example, with the triptych
of unknown authorship in the Church of St. Anne at Gliss, close
to Brieg.&nbsp; But, in the first place, the work at Gliss is
worthy of Holbein himself: I know no wood-carving that can so
rivet the attention; moreover it is coloured with water-colour
and not oil, so that it is tinted, not painted; and, in the
second place, the Gliss triptych belongs to a date (1519) when
artists held neither time nor impressionism as objects, and
hence, though greatly better than the Saas-F&eacute;e chapels as
regards a certain Japanese curiousness of finish and
<i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> of literal transcription, it cannot
even enter the lists with the Saas work as regards
<i>&eacute;lan</i> and dramatic effectiveness.&nbsp; The
difference between the two classes of work is much that between,
say, John Van Eyck or Memling and Rubens or Rembrandt, or, again,
between Giovanni Bellini and Tintoretto; the aims of the one
class of work are incompatible with those of the other.&nbsp;
Moreover, in the Gliss triptych the intention of the designer is
carried out (whether by himself or no) with admirable skill;
whereas at Saas the wisdom of the workman is rather of
Ober-Ammergau than of the Egyptians, and the voice of the poet is
not a little drowned in that of his mouthpiece.&nbsp; If,
however, the reader will bear in mind these somewhat obvious
considerations, and will also remember the pathetic circumstances
under which the chapels were designed&mdash;for Tabachetti when
he reached Saas was no doubt shattered in body and mind by his
four years&rsquo; imprisonment&mdash;he will probably be not less
attracted to them than I observed were many of the visitors both
at Saas-Grund and Saas-F&eacute;e with whom I had the pleasure of
examining them.</p>
<p>I will now run briefly through the other principal works in
the neighbourhood to which I think the reader would be glad to
have his attention directed.</p>
<p>At Saas-F&eacute;e itself the main altar-piece is without
interest, as also one with a figure of St. Sebastian.&nbsp; The
Virgin and Child above the remaining altar are, so far as I
remember them, very good, and greatly superior to the smaller
figures of the same altar-piece.</p>
<p>At Almagel, an hour&rsquo;s walk or so above
Saas-Grund&mdash;a village, the name of which, like those of the
Alphubel, the Monte Moro, and more than one other neighbouring
site, is supposed to be of Saracenic origin&mdash;the main
altar-piece represents a female saint with folded arms being
beheaded by a vigorous man to the left.&nbsp; These two figures
are very good.&nbsp; There are two somewhat inferior elders to
the right, and the composition is crowned by the Assumption of
the Virgin.&nbsp; I like the work, but have no idea who did
it.&nbsp; Two bishops flanking the composition are not so
good.&nbsp; There are two other altars in the church: the
right-hand one has some pleasing figures, not so the
left-hand.</p>
<p>In St. Joseph&rsquo;s Chapel, on the mule-road between
Saas-Grund and Saas-F&eacute;e, the St. Joseph and the two
children are rather nice.&nbsp; In the churches and chapels which
I looked into between Saas and Stalden, I saw many florid
extravagant altar-pieces, but nothing that impressed me
favourably.</p>
<p>In the parish church at Saas-Grund there are two altar-pieces
which deserve attention.&nbsp; In the one over the main altar the
arrangement of the Last Supper in a deep recess half-way up the
composition is very pleasing and effective; in that above the
right-hand altar of the two that stand in the body of the church
there are a number of round lunettes, about eight inches in
diameter, each containing a small but spirited group of wooden
figures.&nbsp; I have lost my notes on these altar-pieces and can
only remember that the main one has been restored, and now
belongs to two different dates, the earlier date being, I should
imagine, about 1670.&nbsp; A similar treatment of the Last Supper
may be found near Brieg in the church of Naters, and no doubt the
two altar-pieces are by the same man.&nbsp; There are, by the
way, two very ambitious altars on either side the main arch
leading to the chance in the church at Naters, of which the one
on the south side contains obvious reminiscences of Gaudenzio
Ferrari&rsquo;s Sta.&nbsp; Maria frescoes at Varallo; but none of
the four altar-pieces in the two transepts tempted me to give
them much attention.&nbsp; As regards the smaller altar-piece at
Saas-Grund, analogous work may be found at Cravagliana, half-way
between Varallo and Fobello, but this last has suffered through
the inveterate habit which Italians have of showing their hatred
towards the enemies of Christ by mutilating the figures that
represent them.&nbsp; Whether the Saas work is by a Valsesian
artist who came over to Switzerland, or whether the Cravagliana
work is by a Swiss who had come to Italy, I cannot say without
further consideration and closer examination than I have been
able to give.&nbsp; The altar-pieces of Mairengo, Chiggiogna,
and, I am told, Lavertezzo, all in the Canton Ticino, are by a
Swiss or German artist who has migrated southward; but the
reverse migration was equally common.</p>
<p>Being in the neighbourhood, and wishing to assure myself
whether the sculptor of the Saas-F&eacute;e chapels had or had
not come lower down the valley, I examined every church and
village which I could hear of as containing anything that might
throw light on this point.&nbsp; I was thus led to Vispertimenen,
a village some three hours above either Visp or Stalden.&nbsp; It
stands very high, and is an almost untouched example of a
medieval village.&nbsp; The altar-piece of the main church is
even more floridly ambitious in its abundance of carving and
gilding than the many other ambitious altar-pieces with which the
Canton Valais abounds.&nbsp; The Apostles are receiving the Holy
Ghost on the first storey of the composition, and they certainly
are receiving it with an overjoyed alacrity and hilarious ecstasy
of <i>allegria spirituale</i> which it would not be easy to
surpass.&nbsp; Above the village, reaching almost to the limits
beyond which there is no cultivation, there stands a series of
chapels like those I have been describing at Saas-F&eacute;e,
only much larger and more ambitious.&nbsp; They are twelve in
number, including the church that crowns the series.&nbsp; The
figures they contain are of wood (so I was assured, but I did not
go inside the chapels): they are life-size, and in some chapels
there are as many as a dozen figures.&nbsp; I should think they
belonged to the later half of the last century, and here, one
would say, sculpture touches the ground; at least, it is not easy
to see how cheap exaggeration can sink an art more deeply.&nbsp;
The only things that at all pleased me were a smiling donkey and
an ecstatic cow in the Nativity chapel.&nbsp; Those who are not
allured by the prospect of seeing perhaps the very worst that can
be done in its own line, need not be at the pains of climbing up
to Vispertimenen.&nbsp; Those, on the other hand, who may find
this sufficient inducement will not be disappointed, and they
will enjoy magnificent views of the Weisshorn and the mountains
near the Dom.</p>
<p>I have already referred to the triptych at Gliss.&nbsp; This
is figured in Wolf&rsquo;s work on Chamonix and the Canton
Valais, but a larger and clearer reproduction of such an
extraordinary work is greatly to be desired.&nbsp; The small
wooden statues above the triptych, as also those above its modern
companion in the south transept, are not less admirable than the
triptych itself.&nbsp; I know of no other like work in wood, and
have no clue whatever as to who the author can have been beyond
the fact that the work is purely German and eminently
Holbeinesque in character.</p>
<p>I was told of some chapels at Rarogne, five or six miles lower
down the valley than Visp.&nbsp; I examined them, and found they
had been stripped of their figures.&nbsp; The few that remained
satisfied me that we have had no loss.&nbsp; Above Brieg there
are two other like series of chapels.&nbsp; I examined the higher
and more promising of the two, but found not one single figure
left.&nbsp; I was told by my driver that the other series, close
to the Pont Napol&eacute;on on the Simplon road, had been also
stripped of its figures, and, there being a heavy storm at the
time, have taken his word for it that this was so.</p>
<h2>THOUGHT AND LANGUAGE <a name="citation16"></a><a
href="#footnote16" class="citation">[16]</a></h2>
<p>Three well-known writers, Professor Max M&uuml;ller, Professor
Mivart, and Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace have lately maintained that
though the theory of descent with modification accounts for the
development of all vegetable life, and of all animals lower than
man, yet that man cannot&mdash;not at least in respect of the
whole of his nature&mdash;be held to have descended from any
animal lower than himself, inasmuch as none lower than man
possesses even the germs of language.&nbsp; Reason, it is
contended&mdash;more especially by Professor Max M&uuml;ller in
his &ldquo;Science of Thought,&rdquo; to which I propose
confining our attention this evening&mdash;is so inseparably
connected with language, that the two are in point of fact
identical; hence it is argued that, as the lower animals have no
germs of language, they can have no germs of reason, and the
inference is drawn that man cannot be conceived as having derived
his own reasoning powers and command of language through descent
from beings in which no germ of either can be found.&nbsp; The
relations therefore between thought and language, interesting in
themselves, acquire additional importance from the fact of their
having become the battle-ground between those who say that the
theory of descent breaks down with man, and those who maintain
that we are descended from some ape-like ancestor long since
extinct.</p>
<p>The contention of those who refuse to admit man unreservedly
into the scheme of evolution is comparatively recent.&nbsp; The
great propounders of evolution, Buffon, Erasmus Darwin and
Lamarck&mdash;not to mention a score of others who wrote at the
close of the last and early part of this present
century&mdash;had no qualms about admitting man into their
system.&nbsp; They have been followed in this respect by the late
Mr. Charles Darwin, and by the greatly more influential part of
our modern biologists, who hold that whatever loss of dignity we
may incur through being proved to be of humble origin, is
compensated by the credit we may claim for having advanced
ourselves to such a high pitch of civilisation; this bids us
expect still further progress, and glorifies our descendants more
than it abases our ancestors.&nbsp; But to whichever view we may
incline on sentimental grounds the fact remains that, while
Charles Darwin declared language to form no impassable barrier
between man and the lower animals, Professor Max M&uuml;ller
calls it the Rubicon which no brute dare cross, and deduces hence
the conclusion that man cannot have descended from an unknown but
certainly speechless ape.</p>
<p>It may perhaps be expected that I should begin a lecture on
the relations between thought and language with some definition
of both these things; but thought, as Sir William Grove said of
motion, is a phenomenon &ldquo;so obvious to simple apprehension,
that to define it would make it more obscure.&rdquo; <a
name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17"
class="citation">[17]</a>&nbsp; Definitions are useful where
things are new to us, but they are superfluous about those that
are already familiar, and mischievous, so far as they are
possible at all, in respect of all those things that enter so
profoundly and intimately into our being that in them we must
either live or bear no life.&nbsp; To vivisect the more vital
processes of thought is to suspend, if not to destroy them; for
thought can think about everything more healthily and easily than
about itself.&nbsp; It is like its instrument the brain, which
knows nothing of any injuries inflicted upon itself.&nbsp; As
regards what is new to us, a definition will sometimes dilute a
difficulty, and help us to swallow that which might choke us
undiluted; but to define when we have once well swallowed is to
unsettle, rather than settle, our digestion.&nbsp; Definitions,
again, are like steps cut in a steep slope of ice, or shells
thrown on to a greasy pavement; they give us foothold, and enable
us to advance, but when we are at our journey&rsquo;s end we want
them no longer.&nbsp; Again, they are useful as mental fluxes,
and as helping us to fuse new ideas with our older ones.&nbsp;
They present us with some tags and ends of ideas that we have
already mastered, on to which we can hitch our new ones; but to
multiply them in respect of such a matter as thought, is like
scratching the bite of a gnat; the more we scratch the more we
want to scratch; the more we define the more we shall have to go
on defining the words we have used in our definitions, and shall
end by setting up a serious mental raw in the place of a small
uneasiness that was after all quite endurable.&nbsp; We know too
well what thought is, to be able to know that we know it, and I
am persuaded there is no one in this room but understands what is
meant by thought and thinking well enough for all the purposes of
this discussion.&nbsp; Whoever does not know this without words
will not learn it for all the words and definitions that are laid
before him.&nbsp; The more, indeed, he hears, the more confused
he will become.&nbsp; I shall, therefore, merely premise that I
use the word &ldquo;thought&rdquo; in the same sense as that in
which it is generally used by people who say that they think this
or that.&nbsp; At any rate, it will be enough if I take Professor
Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s own definition, and say that its essence
consists in a bringing together of mental images and ideas with
deductions therefrom, and with a corresponding power of detaching
them from one another.&nbsp; Hobbes, the Professor tells us,
maintained this long ago, when he said that all our thinking
consists of addition and subtraction&mdash;that is to say, in
bringing ideas together, and in detaching them from one
another.</p>
<p>Turning from thought to language, we observe that the word is
derived from the French <i>langue</i>, or <i>tongue</i>.&nbsp;
Strictly, therefore, it means <i>tonguage</i>.&nbsp; This,
however, takes account of but a very small part of the ideas that
underlie the word.&nbsp; It does, indeed, seize a familiar and
important detail of everyday speech, though it may be doubted
whether the tongue has more to do with speaking than lips, teeth
and throat have, but it makes no attempt at grasping and
expressing the essential characteristic of speech.&nbsp; Anything
done with the tongue, even though it involve no speaking at all,
is <i>tonguage</i>; eating oranges is as much tonguage as speech
is.&nbsp; The word, therefore, though it tells us in part how
speech is effected, reveals nothing of that ulterior meaning
which is nevertheless inseparable from any right use of the words
either &ldquo;speech&rdquo; or &ldquo;language.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
presents us with what is indeed a very frequent adjunct of
conversation, but the use of written characters, or the
finger-speech of deaf mutes, is enough to show that the word
&ldquo;language&rdquo; omits all reference to the most essential
characteristics of the idea, which in practice it nevertheless
very sufficiently presents to us.&nbsp; I hope presently to make
it clear to you how and why it should do so.&nbsp; The word is
incomplete in the first place, because it omits all reference to
the ideas which words, speech or language are intended to convey,
and there can be no true word without its actually or potentially
conveying an idea.&nbsp; Secondly, it makes no allusion to the
person or persons to whom the ideas are to be conveyed.&nbsp;
Language is not language unless it not only expresses fairly
definite and coherent ideas, but unless it also conveys these
ideas to some other living intelligent being, either man or
brute, that can understand them.&nbsp; We may speak to a dog or
horse, but not to a stone.&nbsp; If we make pretence of doing so
we are in reality only talking to ourselves.&nbsp; The person or
animal spoken to is half the battle&mdash;a half, moreover, which
is essential to there being any battle at all.&nbsp; It takes two
people to say a thing&mdash;a sayee as well as a sayer.&nbsp; The
one is as essential to any true saying as the other.&nbsp; A. may
have spoken, but if B. has not heard, there has been nothing
said, and he must speak again.&nbsp; True, the belief on
A.&rsquo;s part that he had a <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> sayee in B.,
saves his speech qu&acirc; him, but it has been barren and left
no fertile issue.&nbsp; It has failed to fulfil the conditions of
true speech, which involve not only that A. should speak, but
also that B. should hear.&nbsp; True, again, we often speak of
loose, incoherent, indefinite language; but by doing so we imply,
and rightly, that we are calling that language which is not true
language at all.&nbsp; People, again, sometimes talk to
themselves without intending that any other person should hear
them, but this is not well done, and does harm to those who
practise it.&nbsp; It is abnormal, whereas our concern is with
normal and essential characteristics; we may, therefore, neglect
both delirious babblings, and the cases in which a person is
regarding him or herself, as it were, from outside, and treating
himself as though he were some one else.</p>
<p>Inquiring, then, what are the essentials, the presence of
which constitutes language, while their absence negatives it
altogether, we find that Professor Max M&uuml;ller restricts them
to the use of grammatical articulate words that we can write or
speak, and denies that anything can be called language unless it
can be written or spoken in articulate words and sentences.&nbsp;
He also denies that we can think at all unless we do so in words;
that is to say, in sentences with verbs and nouns.&nbsp; Indeed
he goes so far as to say upon his title-page that there can be no
reason&mdash;which I imagine comes to much the same thing as
thought&mdash;without language, and no language without
reason.</p>
<p>Against the assertion that there can be no true language
without reason I have nothing to say.&nbsp; But when the
Professor says that there can be no reason, or thought, without
language, his opponents contend, as it seems to me, with greater
force, that thought, though infinitely aided, extended and
rendered definite through the invention of words, nevertheless
existed so fully as to deserve no other name thousands, if not
millions of years before words had entered into it at all.&nbsp;
Words, they say, are a comparatively recent invention, for the
fuller expression of something that was already in existence.</p>
<p>Children, they urge, are often evidently thinking and
reasoning, though they can neither think nor speak in
words.&nbsp; If you ask me to define reason, I answer as before
that this can no more be done than thought, truth or motion can
be defined.&nbsp; Who has answered the question, &ldquo;What is
truth?&rdquo;&nbsp; Man cannot see God and live.&nbsp; We cannot
go so far back upon ourselves as to undermine our own
foundations; if we try to do we topple over, and lose that very
reason about which we vainly try to reason.&nbsp; If we let the
foundations be, we know well enough that they are there, and we
can build upon them in all security.&nbsp; We cannot, then,
define reason nor crib, cabin and confine it within a
thus-far-shalt-thou-go-and-no-further.&nbsp; Who can define heat
or cold, or night or day?&nbsp; Yet, so long as we hold fast by
current consent, our chances of error for want of better
definition are so small that no sensible person will consider
them.&nbsp; In like manner, if we hold by current consent or
common sense, which is the same thing, about reason, we shall not
find the want of an academic definition hinder us from a
reasonable conclusion.&nbsp; What nurse or mother will doubt that
her infant child can reason within the limits of its own
experience, long before it can formulate its reason in
articulately worded thought?&nbsp; If the development of any
given animal is, as our opponents themselves admit, an epitome of
the history of its whole anterior development, surely the fact
that speech is an accomplishment acquired after birth so
artificially that children who have gone wild in the woods lose
it if they have ever learned it, points to the conclusion that
man&rsquo;s ancestors only learned to express themselves in
articulate language at a comparatively recent period.&nbsp;
Granted that they learn to think and reason continually the more
and more fully for having done so, will common sense permit us to
suppose that they could neither think nor reason at all till they
could convey their ideas in words?</p>
<p>I will return later to the reason of the lower animals, but
will now deal with the question what it is that constitutes
language in the most comprehensive sense that can be properly
attached to it.&nbsp; I have said already that language to be
language at all must not only convey fairly definite coherent
ideas, but must also convey them to another living being.&nbsp;
Whenever two living beings have conveyed and received ideas,
there has been language, whether looks or gestures or words
spoken or written have been the vehicle by means of which the
ideas have travelled.&nbsp; Some ideas crawl, some run, some fly;
and in this case words are the wings they fly with, but they are
only the wings of thought or of ideas, they are not the thought
or ideas themselves, nor yet, as Professor Max M&uuml;ller would
have it, inseparably connected with them.&nbsp; Last summer I was
at an inn in Sicily, where there was a deaf and dumb waiter; he
had been born so, and could neither write nor read.&nbsp; What
had he to do with words or words with him?&nbsp; Are we to say,
then, that this most active, amiable and intelligent fellow could
neither think nor reason?&nbsp; One day I had had my dinner and
had left the hotel.&nbsp; A friend came in, and the waiter saw
him look for me in the place I generally occupied.&nbsp; He
instantly came up to my friend, and moved his two forefingers in
a way that suggested two people going about together, this meant
&ldquo;your friend&rdquo;; he then moved his forefingers
horizontally across his eyes, this meant, &ldquo;who wears
divided spectacles&rdquo;; he made two fierce marks over the
sockets of his eyes, this meant, &ldquo;with the heavy
eyebrows&rdquo;; he pulled his chin, and then touched his white
shirt, to say that my beard was white.&nbsp; Having thus
identified me as a friend of the person he was speaking to, and
as having a white beard, heavy eyebrows, and wearing divided
spectacles, he made a munching movement with his jaws to say that
I had had my dinner; and finally, by making two fingers imitate
walking on the table, he explained that I had gone away.&nbsp; My
friend, however, wanted to know how long I had been gone, so he
pulled out his watch and looked inquiringly.&nbsp; The man at
once slapped himself on the back, and held up the five fingers of
one hand, to say it was five minutes ago.&nbsp; All this was done
as rapidly as though it had been said in words; and my friend,
who knew the man well, understood without a moment&rsquo;s
hesitation.&nbsp; Are we to say that this man had no thought, nor
reason, nor language, merely because he had not a single word of
any kind in his head, which I am assured he had not; for, as I
have said, he could not speak with his fingers?&nbsp; Is it
possible to deny that a dialogue&mdash;an intelligent
conversation&mdash;had passed between the two men?&nbsp; And if
conversation, then surely it is technical and pedantic to deny
that all the essential elements of language were present.&nbsp;
The signs and tokens used by this poor fellow were as rude an
instrument of expression, in comparison with ordinary language,
as going on one&rsquo;s hands and knees is in comparison with
walking, or as walking compared with going by train; but it is as
great an abuse of words to limit the word &ldquo;language&rdquo;
to mere words written or spoken, as it would be to limit the idea
of a locomotive to a railway engine.&nbsp; This may indeed pass
in ordinary conversation, where so much must be suppressed if
talk is to be got through at all, but it is intolerable when we
are inquiring about the relations between thought and
words.&nbsp; To do so is to let words become as it were the
masters of thought, on the ground that the fact of their being
only its servants and appendages is so obvious that it is
generally allowed to go without saying.</p>
<p>If all that Professor Max M&uuml;ller means to say is, that no
animal but man commands an articulate language, with verbs and
nouns, or is ever likely to command one (and I question whether
in reality he means much more than this), no one will differ from
him.&nbsp; No dog or elephant has one word for bread, another for
meat, and another for water.&nbsp; Yet, when we watch a cat or
dog dreaming, as they often evidently do, can we doubt that the
dream is accompanied by a mental image of the thing that is
dreamed of, much like what we experience in dreams ourselves, and
much doubtless like the mental images which must have passed
through the mind of my deaf and dumb waiter?&nbsp; If they have
mental images in sleep, can we doubt that waking, also, they
picture things before their mind&rsquo;s eyes, and see them much
as we do&mdash;too vaguely indeed to admit of our thinking that
we actually see the objects themselves, but definitely enough for
us to be able to recognise the idea or object of which we are
thinking, and to connect it with any other idea, object, or sign
that we may think appropriate?</p>
<p>Here we have touched on the second essential element of
language.&nbsp; We laid it down, that its essence lay in the
communication of an idea from one intelligent being to another;
but no ideas can be communicated at all except by the aid of
conventions to which both parties have agreed to attach an
identical meaning.&nbsp; The agreement may be very informal, and
may pass so unconsciously from one generation to another that its
existence can only be recognised by the aid of much
introspection, but it will be always there.&nbsp; A sayer, a
sayee, and a convention, no matter what, agreed upon between them
as inseparably attached to the idea which it is intended to
convey&mdash;these comprise all the essentials of language.&nbsp;
Where these are present there is language; where any of them are
wanting there is no language.&nbsp; It is not necessary for the
sayee to be able to speak and become a sayer.&nbsp; If he
comprehends the sayer&mdash;that is to say, if he attaches the
same meaning to a certain symbol as the sayer does&mdash;if he is
a party to the bargain whereby it is agreed upon by both that any
given symbol shall be attached invariably to a certain idea, so
that in virtue of the principle of associated ideas the symbol
shall never be present without immediately carrying the idea
along with it, then all the essentials of language are complied
with, and there has been true speech though never a word was
spoken.</p>
<p>The lower animals, therefore, many of them, possess a part of
our own language, though they cannot speak it, and hence do not
possess it so fully as we do.&nbsp; They cannot say
&ldquo;bread,&rdquo; &ldquo;meat,&rdquo; or &ldquo;water,&rdquo;
but there are many that readily learn what ideas they ought to
attach to these symbols when they are presented to them.&nbsp; It
is idle to say that a cat does not know what the cat&rsquo;s-meat
man means when he says &ldquo;meat.&rdquo;&nbsp; The cat knows
just as well, neither better nor worse than the cat&rsquo;s-meat
man does, and a great deal better than I myself understand much
that is said by some very clever people at Oxford or
Cambridge.&nbsp; There is more true employment of language, more
<i>bon&acirc; fide</i> currency of speech, between a sayer and a
sayee who understand each other, though neither of them can speak
a word, than between a sayer who can speak with the tongues of
men and of angels without being clear about his own meaning, and
a sayee who can himself utter the same words, but who is only in
imperfect agreement with the sayer as to the ideas which the
words or symbols that he utters are intended to convey.&nbsp; The
nature of the symbols counts for nothing; the gist of the matter
is in the perfect harmony between sayer and sayee as to the
significance that is to be associated with them.</p>
<p>Professor Max M&uuml;ller admits that we share with the lower
animals what he calls an emotional language, and continues that
we may call their interjections and imitations language if we
like, as we speak of the language of the eyes or the eloquence of
mute nature, but he warns us against mistaking metaphor for
fact.&nbsp; It is indeed mere metaphor to talk of the eloquence
of mute nature, or the language of winds and waves.&nbsp; There
is no intercommunion of mind with mind by means of a covenanted
symbol; but it is only an apparent, not a real, metaphor to say
that two pairs of eyes have spoken when they have signalled to
one another something which they both understand.&nbsp; A
schoolboy at home for the holidays wants another plate of
pudding, and does not like to apply officially for more.&nbsp; He
catches the servant&rsquo;s eye and looks at the pudding; the
servant understands, takes his plate without a word, and gets him
some.&nbsp; Is it metaphor to say that the boy asked the servant
to do this, or is it not rather pedantry to insist on the letter
of a bond and deny its spirit, by denying that language passed,
on the ground that the symbols covenanted upon and assented to by
both were uttered and received by eyes and not by mouth and
ears?&nbsp; When the lady drank to the gentleman only with her
eyes, and he pledged with his, was there no conversation because
there was neither noun nor verb?&nbsp; Eyes are verbs, and
glasses of wine are good nouns enough as between those who
understand one another.&nbsp; Whether the ideas underlying them
are expressed and conveyed by eyeage or by tonguage is a detail
that matters nothing.</p>
<p>But everything we say is metaphorical if we choose to be
captious.&nbsp; Scratch the simplest expressions, and you will
find the metaphor.&nbsp; Written words are handage, inkage and
paperage; it is only by metaphor, or substitution and
transposition of ideas, that we can call them language.&nbsp;
They are indeed potential language, and the symbols employed
presuppose nouns, verbs, and the other parts of speech; but for
the most part it is in what we read between the lines that the
profounder meaning of any letter is conveyed.&nbsp; There are
words unwritten and untranslatable into any nouns that are
nevertheless felt as above, about and underneath the gross
material symbols that lie scrawled upon the paper; and the deeper
the feeling with which anything is written the more pregnant will
it be of meaning which can be conveyed securely enough, but which
loses rather than gains if it is squeezed into a sentence, and
limited by the parts of speech.&nbsp; The language is not in the
words but in the heart-to-heartness of the thing, which is helped
by words, but is nearer and farther than they.&nbsp; A
correspondent wrote to me once, many years ago, &ldquo;If I could
think to you without words you would understand me
better.&rdquo;&nbsp; But surely in this he was thinking to me,
and without words, and I did understand him better . . .&nbsp; So
it is not by the words that I am too presumptuously venturing to
speak to-night that your opinions will be formed or
modified.&nbsp; They will be formed or modified, if either, by
something that you will feel, but which I have not spoken, to the
full as much as by anything that I have actually uttered.&nbsp;
You may say that this borders on mysticism.&nbsp; Perhaps it
does, but their really is some mysticism in nature.</p>
<p>To return, however, to <i>terra firma</i>.&nbsp; I believe I
am right in saying that the essence of language lies in the
intentional conveyance of ideas from one living being to another
through the instrumentality of arbitrary tokens or symbols agreed
upon, and understood by both as being associated with the
particular ideas in question.&nbsp; The nature of the symbol
chosen is a matter of indifference; it may be anything that
appeals to human senses, and is not too hot or too heavy; the
essence of the matter lies in a mutual covenant that whatever it
is it shall stand invariably for the same thing, or nearly
so.</p>
<p>We shall see this more easily if we observe the differences
between written and spoken language.&nbsp; The written word
&ldquo;stone,&rdquo; and the spoken word, are each of them
symbols arrived at in the first instance arbitrarily.&nbsp; They
are neither of them more like the other than they are to the idea
of a stone which rises before our minds, when we either see or
hear the word, or than this idea again is like the actual stone
itself, but nevertheless the spoken symbol and the written one
each alike convey with certainty the combination of ideas to
which we have agreed to attach them.</p>
<p>The written symbol is formed with the hand, appeals to the
eye, leaves a material trace as long as paper and ink last, can
travel as far as paper and ink can travel, and can be imprinted
on eye after eye practically <i>ad infinitum</i> both as regards
time and space.</p>
<p>The spoken symbol is formed by means of various organs in or
about the mouth, appeals to the ear, not the eye, perishes
instantly without material trace, and if it lives at all does so
only in the minds of those who heard it.&nbsp; The range of its
action is no wider than that within which a voice can be heard;
and every time a fresh impression is wanted the type must be set
up anew.</p>
<p>The written symbol extends infinitely, as regards time and
space, the range within which one mind can communicate with
another; it gives the writer&rsquo;s mind a life limited by the
duration of ink, paper, and readers, as against that of his flesh
and blood body.&nbsp; On the other hand, it takes longer to learn
the rules so as to be able to apply them with ease and security,
and even then they cannot be applied so quickly and easily as
those attaching to spoken symbols.&nbsp; Moreover, the spoken
symbol admits of a hundred quick and subtle adjuncts by way of
action, tone and expression, so that no one will use written
symbols unless either for the special advantages of permanence
and travelling power, or because he is incapacitated from using
spoken ones.&nbsp; This, however, is hardly to the point; the
point is that these two conventional combinations of symbols,
that are as unlike one another as the Hallelujah Chorus is to St.
Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, are the one as much language as the
other; and we therefore inquire what this very patent fact
reveals to us about the more essential characteristics of
language itself.&nbsp; What is the common bond that unites these
two classes of symbols that seem at first sight to have nothing
in common, and makes the one raise the idea of language in our
minds as readily as the other?&nbsp; The bond lies in the fact
that both are a set of conventional tokens or symbols, agreed
upon between the parties to whom they appeal as being attached
invariably to the same ideas, and because they are being made as
a means of communion between one mind and another,&mdash;for a
memorandum made for a person&rsquo;s own later use is nothing but
a communication from an earlier mind to a later and modified one;
it is therefore in reality a communication from one mind to
another as much as though it had been addressed to another
person.</p>
<p>We see, therefore, that the nature of the outward and visible
sign to which the inward and spiritual idea of language is
attached does not matter.&nbsp; It may be the firing of a gun; it
may be an old semaphore telegraph; it may be the movements of a
needle; a look, a gesture, the breaking of a twig by an Indian to
tell some one that he has passed that way: a twig broken
designedly with this end in view is a letter addressed to
whomsoever it may concern, as much as though it had been written
out in full on bark or paper.&nbsp; It does not matter one straw
what it is, provided it is agreed upon in concert, and stuck
to.&nbsp; Just as the lowest forms of life nevertheless present
us with all the essential characteristics of livingness, and are
as much alive in their own humble way as the most highly
developed organisms, so the rudest intentional and effectual
communication between two minds through the instrumentality of a
concerted symbol is as much language as the most finished oratory
of Mr. Gladstone.&nbsp; I demur therefore to the assertion that
the lower animals have no language, inasmuch as they cannot
themselves articulate a grammatical sentence.&nbsp; I do not
indeed pretend that when the cat calls upon the tiles it uses
what it consciously and introspectively recognises as language;
it says what it has to say without introspection, and in the
ordinary course of business, as one of the common forms of
courtship.&nbsp; It no more knows that it has been using language
than M. Jourdain knew he had been speaking prose, but M.
Jourdain&rsquo;s knowing or not knowing was neither here nor
there.</p>
<p>Anything which can be made to hitch on invariably to a
definite idea that can carry some distance&mdash;say an inch at
the least, and which can be repeated at pleasure, can be pressed
into the service of language.&nbsp; Mrs. Bentley, wife of the
famous Dr. Bentley of Trinity College, Cambridge, used to send
her snuff-box to the college buttery when she wanted beer,
instead of a written order.&nbsp; If the snuff-box came the beer
was sent, but if there was no snuff-box there was no beer.&nbsp;
Wherein did the snuff-box differ more from a written order, than
a written order differs from a spoken one?&nbsp; The snuff-box
was for the time being language.&nbsp; It sounds strange to say
that one might take a pinch of snuff out of a sentence, but if
the servant had helped him or herself to a pinch while carrying
it to the buttery this is what would have been done; for if a
snuff-box can say &ldquo;Send me a quart of beer,&rdquo; so
efficiently that the beer is sent, it is impossible to say that
it is not a <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> sentence.&nbsp; As for the
recipient of the message, the butler did not probably translate
the snuff-box into articulate nouns and verbs; as soon as he saw
it he just went down into the cellar and drew the beer, and if he
thought at all, it was probably about something else.&nbsp; Yet
he must have been thinking without words, or he would have drawn
too much beer or too little, or have spilt it in the bringing it
up, and we may be sure that he did none of these things.</p>
<p>You will, of course, observe that if Mrs. Bentley had sent the
snuff-box to the buttery of St. John&rsquo;s College instead of
Trinity, it would not have been language, for there would have
been no covenant between sayer and sayee as to what the symbol
should represent, there would have been no previously established
association of ideas in the mind of the butler of St.
John&rsquo;s between beer and snuff-box; the connection was
artificial, arbitrary, and by no means one of those in respect of
which an impromptu bargain might be proposed by the very symbol
itself, and assented to without previous formality by the person
to whom it was presented.&nbsp; More briefly, the butler of St.
John&rsquo;s would not have been able to understand and read it
aright.&nbsp; It would have been a dead letter to him&mdash;a
snuff-box and not a letter; whereas to the butler of Trinity it
was a letter and not a snuff-box.</p>
<p>You will also note that it was only at the moment when he was
looking at it and accepting it as a message that it flashed forth
from snuff-box-hood into the light and life of living
utterance.&nbsp; As soon as it had kindled the butler into
sending a single quart of beer, its force was spent until Mrs.
Bentley threw her soul into it again and charged it anew by
wanting more beer, and sending it down accordingly.</p>
<p>Again, take the ring which the Earl of Essex sent to Queen
Elizabeth, but which the queen did not receive.&nbsp; This was
intended as a sentence, but failed to become effectual language
because the sensible material symbol never reached those sentient
organs which it was intended to affect.&nbsp; A book, again,
however full of excellent words it may be, is not language when
it is merely standing on a bookshelf.&nbsp; It speaks to no one,
unless when being actually read, or quoted from by an act of
memory.&nbsp; It is potential language as a lucifer-match is
potential fire, but it is no more language till it is in contact
with a recipient mind, than a match is fire till it is struck,
and is being consumed.</p>
<p>A piece of music, again, without any words at all, or a song
with words that have nothing in the world to do with the ideas
which it is nevertheless made to convey, is often very effectual
language.&nbsp; Much lying, and all irony depends on tampering
with covenanted symbols, and making those that are usually
associated with one set of ideas convey by a sleight of mind
others of a different nature.&nbsp; That is why irony is
intolerably fatiguing unless very sparingly used.&nbsp; Take the
song which Blondel sang under the window of King Richard&rsquo;s
prison.&nbsp; There was not one syllable in it to say that
Blondel was there, and was going to help the king to get out of
prison.&nbsp; It was about some silly love affair, but it was a
letter all the same, and the king made language of what would
otherwise have been no language, by guessing the meaning, that is
to say by perceiving that he was expected to enter then and there
into a new covenant as to the meaning of the symbols that were
presented to him, understanding what this covenant was to be, and
acquiescing in it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, no ingenuity can torture language into
being a fit word to use in connection with either sounds or any
other symbols that have not been intended to convey a meaning, or
again in connection with either sounds or symbols in respect of
which there has been no covenant between sayer and sayee.&nbsp;
When we hear people speaking a foreign language&mdash;we will say
Welsh&mdash;we feel that though they are no doubt using what is
very good language as between themselves, there is no language
whatever as far as we are concerned.&nbsp; We call it lingo, not
language.&nbsp; The Chinese letters on a tea-chest might as well
not be there, for all that they say to us, though the Chinese
find them very much to the purpose.&nbsp; They are a covenant to
which we have been no parties&mdash;to which our intelligence has
affixed no signature.</p>
<p>We have already seen that it is in virtue of such an
understood covenant that symbols so unlike one another as the
written word &ldquo;stone&rdquo; and the spoken word alike at
once raise the idea of a stone in our minds.&nbsp; See how the
same holds good as regards the different languages that pass
current in different nations.&nbsp; The letters p, i, e, r, r, e
convey the idea of a stone to a Frenchman as readily as s, t, o,
n, e do to ourselves.&nbsp; And why? because that is the covenant
that has been struck between those who speak and those who are
spoken to.&nbsp; Our &ldquo;stone&rdquo; conveys no idea to a
Frenchman, nor his &ldquo;pierre&rdquo; to us, unless we have
done what is commonly called acquiring one another&rsquo;s
language.&nbsp; To acquire a foreign language is only to learn
and adhere to the covenants in respect of symbols which the
nation in question has adopted and adheres to.</p>
<p>Till we have done this we neither of us know the rules, so to
speak, of the game that the other is playing, and cannot,
therefore, play together; but the convention being once known and
assented to, it does not matter whether we raise the idea of a
stone by the word &ldquo;lapis,&rdquo; or by
&ldquo;lithos,&rdquo; &ldquo;pietra,&rdquo; &ldquo;pierre,&rdquo;
&ldquo;stein,&rdquo; &ldquo;stane&rdquo; or &ldquo;stone&rdquo;;
we may choose what symbols written or spoken we choose, and one
set, unless they are of unwieldy length will do as well as
another, if we can get other people to choose the same and stick
to them; it is the accepting and sticking to them that matters,
not the symbols.&nbsp; The whole power of spoken language is
vested in the invariableness with which certain symbols are
associated with certain ideas.&nbsp; If we are strict in always
connecting the same symbols with the same ideas, we speak well,
keep our meaning clear to ourselves, and convey it readily and
accurately to any one who is also fairly strict.&nbsp; If, on the
other hand, we use the same combination of symbols for one thing
one day and for another the next, we abuse our symbols instead of
using them, and those who indulge in slovenly habits in this
respect ere long lose the power alike of thinking and of
expressing themselves correctly.&nbsp; The symbols, however, in
the first instance, may be anything in the wide world that we
have a fancy for.&nbsp; They have no more to do with the ideas
they serve to convey than money has with the things that it
serves to buy.</p>
<p>The principle of association, as every one knows, involves
that whenever two things have been associated sufficiently
together, the suggestion of one of them to the mind shall
immediately raise a suggestion of the other.&nbsp; It is in
virtue of this principle that language, as we so call it, exists
at all, for the essence of language consists, as I have said
perhaps already too often, in the fixity with which certain ideas
are invariably connected with certain symbols.&nbsp; But this
being so, it is hard to see how we can deny that the lower
animals possess the germs of a highly rude and unspecialised, but
still true language, unless we also deny that they have any ideas
at all; and this I gather is what Professor Max M&uuml;ller in a
quiet way rather wishes to do.&nbsp; Thus he says, &ldquo;It is
easy enough to show that animals communicate, but this is a fact
which has never been doubted.&nbsp; Dogs who growl and bark leave
no doubt in the minds of other dogs or cats, or even of man, of
what they mean, but growling and barking are not language, nor do
they even contain the elements of language.&rdquo; <a
name="citation18"></a><a href="#footnote18"
class="citation">[18]</a></p>
<p>I observe the Professor says that animals communicate without
saying what it is that they communicate.&nbsp; I believe this to
have been because if he said that the lower animals communicate
their ideas, this would be to admit that they have ideas; if so,
and if, as they present every appearance of doing, they can
remember, reflect upon, modify these ideas according to modified
surroundings, and interchange them with one another, how is it
possible to deny them the germs of thought, language, and
reason&mdash;not to say a good deal more than the germs?&nbsp; It
seems to me that not knowing what else to say that animals
communicated if it was not ideas, and not knowing what mess he
might not get into if he admitted that they had ideas at all, he
thought it safer to omit his accusative case altogether.</p>
<p>That growling and barking cannot be called a very highly
specialised language goes without saying; they are, however, so
much diversified in character, according to circumstances, that
they place a considerable number of symbols at an animal&rsquo;s
command, and he invariably attaches the same symbol to the same
idea.&nbsp; A cat never purrs when she is angry, nor spits when
she is pleased.&nbsp; When she rubs her head against any one
affectionately it is her symbol for saying that she is very fond
of him, and she expects, and usually finds that it will be
understood.&nbsp; If she sees her mistress raise her hand as
though to pretend to strike her, she knows that it is the symbol
her mistress invariably attaches to the idea of sending her away,
and as such she accepts it.&nbsp; Granted that the symbols in use
among the lower animals are fewer and less highly differentiated
than in the case of any known human language, and therefore that
animal language is incomparably less subtle and less capable of
expressing delicate shades of meaning than our own, these
differences are nevertheless only those that exist between highly
developed and inchoate language; they do not involve those that
distinguish language from no language.&nbsp; They are the
differences between the undifferentiated protoplasm of the amoeba
and our own complex organisation; they are not the differences
between life and no life.&nbsp; In animal language as much as in
human there is a mind intentionally making use of a symbol
accepted by another mind as invariably attached to a certain
idea, in order to produce that idea in the mind which it is
desired to affect&mdash;more briefly, there is a sayer, a sayee,
and a covenanted symbol designedly applied.&nbsp; Our own speech
is vertebrated and articulated by means of nouns, verbs, and the
rules of grammar.&nbsp; A dog&rsquo;s speech is invertebrate, but
I do not see how it is possible to deny that it possesses all the
essential elements of language.</p>
<p>I have said nothing about Professor R. L. Garner&rsquo;s
researches into the language of apes, because they have not yet
been so far verified and accepted as to make it safe to rely upon
them; but when he lays it down that all voluntary sounds are the
products of thought, and that, if they convey a meaning to
another, they perform the functions of human speech, he says what
I believe will commend itself to any unsophisticated mind.&nbsp;
I could have wished, however, that he had not limited himself to
sounds, and should have preferred his saying what I doubt not he
would readily accept&mdash;I mean, that all symbols or tokens of
whatever kind, if voluntarily adopted as such, are the products
of thought, and perform the functions of human speech; but I
cannot too often remind you that nothing can be considered as
fulfilling the conditions of language, except a voluntary
application of a recognised token in order to convey a more or
less definite meaning, with the intention doubtless of thus
purchasing as it were some other desired meaning and consequent
sensation.&nbsp; It is astonishing how closely in this respect
money and words resemble one another.&nbsp; Money indeed may be
considered as the most universal and expressive of all
languages.&nbsp; For gold and silver coins are no more money when
not in the actual process of being voluntarily used in purchase,
than words not so in use are language.&nbsp; Pounds, shillings
and pence are recognised covenanted tokens, the outward and
visible signs of an inward and spiritual purchasing power, but
till in actual use they are only potential money, as the symbols
of language, whatever they may be, are only potential language
till they are passing between two minds.&nbsp; It is the power
and will to apply the symbols that alone gives life to money, and
as long as these are in abeyance the money is in abeyance also;
the coins may be safe in one&rsquo;s pocket, but they are as dead
as a log till they begin to burn in it, and so are our words till
they begin to burn within us.</p>
<p>The real question, however, as to the substantial underlying
identity between the language of the lower animals and our own,
turns upon that other question whether or no, in spite of an
immeasurable difference of degree, the thought and reason of man
and of the lower animals is essentially the same.&nbsp; No one
will expect a dog to master and express the varied ideas that are
incessantly arising in connection with human affairs.&nbsp; He is
a pauper as against a millionaire.&nbsp; To ask him to do so
would be like giving a street-boy sixpence and telling him to go
and buy himself a founder&rsquo;s share in the New River
Company.&nbsp; He would not even know what was meant, and even if
he did it would take several millions of sixpences to buy
one.&nbsp; It is astonishing what a clever workman will do with
very modest tools, or again how far a thrifty housewife will make
a very small sum of money go, or again in like manner how many
ideas an intelligent brute can receive and convey with its very
limited vocabulary; but no one will pretend that a dog&rsquo;s
intelligence can ever reach the level of a man&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
What we do maintain is that, within its own limited range, it is
of the same essential character as our own, and that though a
dog&rsquo;s ideas in respect of human affairs are both vague and
narrow, yet in respect of canine affairs they are precise enough
and extensive enough to deserve no other name than thought or
reason.&nbsp; We hold moreover that they communicate their ideas
in essentially the same manner as we do&mdash;that is to say, by
the instrumentality of a code of symbols attached to certain
states of mind and material objects, in the first instance
arbitrarily, but so persistently, that the presentation of the
symbol immediately carries with it the idea which it is intended
to convey.&nbsp; Animals can thus receive and impart ideas on all
that most concerns them.&nbsp; As my great namesake said some two
hundred years ago, they know &ldquo;what&rsquo;s what, and
that&rsquo;s as high as metaphysic wit can fly.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
they not only know what&rsquo;s what themselves, but can impart
to one another any new what&rsquo;s-whatness that they may have
acquired, for they are notoriously able to instruct and correct
one another.</p>
<p>Against this Professor Max M&uuml;ller contends that we can
know nothing of what goes on in the mind of any lower animal,
inasmuch as we are not lower animals ourselves.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
can imagine anything we like about what passes in the mind of an
animal,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;we can know absolutely
nothing.&rdquo; <a name="citation19"></a><a href="#footnote19"
class="citation">[19]</a>&nbsp; It is something to have it in
evidence that he conceives animals as having a mind at all, but
it is not easy to see how they can be supposed to have a mind,
without being able to acquire ideas, and having acquired, to
read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest them.&nbsp; Surely the
mistake of requiring too much evidence is hardly less great than
that of being contented with too little.&nbsp; We, too, are
animals, and can no more refuse to infer reason from certain
visible actions in their case than we can in our own.&nbsp; If
Professor Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s plea were allowed, we should
have to deny our right to infer confidently what passes in the
mind of any one not ourselves, inasmuch as we are not that
person.&nbsp; We never, indeed, can obtain irrefragable certainty
about this or any other matter, but we can be sure enough in many
cases to warrant our staking all that is most precious to us on
the soundness of our opinion.&nbsp; Moreover, if the Professor
denies our right to infer that animals reason, on the ground that
we are not animals enough ourselves to be able to form an
opinion, with what right does he infer so confidently himself
that they do not reason?&nbsp; And how, if they present every one
of those appearances which we are accustomed to connect with the
communication of an idea from one mind to another, can we deny
that they have a language of their own, though it is one which in
most cases we can neither speak nor understand?&nbsp; How can we
say that a sentinel rook, when it sees a man with a gun and warns
the other rooks by a concerted note which they all show that they
understand by immediately taking flight, should not be credited
both with reason and the germs of language?</p>
<p>After all, a professor, whether of philology, psychology,
biology, or any other ology, is hardly the kind of person to whom
we should appeal on such an elementary question as that of animal
intelligence and language.&nbsp; We might as well ask a botanist
to tell us whether grass grows, or a meteorologist to tell us if
it has left off raining.&nbsp; If it is necessary to appeal to
any one, I should prefer the opinion of an intelligent gamekeeper
to that of any professor, however learned.&nbsp; The keepers,
again, at the Zoological Gardens, have exceptional opportunities
for studying the minds of animals&mdash;modified, indeed, by
captivity, but still minds of animals.&nbsp; Grooms, again, and
dog-fanciers, are to the full as able to form an intelligent
opinion on the reason and language of animals as any University
Professor, and so are cats&rsquo;-meat men.&nbsp; I have
repeatedly asked gamekeepers and keepers at the Zoological
Gardens whether animals could reason and converse with one
another, and have always found myself regarded somewhat
contemptuously for having even asked the question.&nbsp; I once
said to a friend, in the hearing of a keeper at the Zoological
Gardens, that the penguin was very stupid.&nbsp; The man was
furious, and jumped upon me at once.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not
stupid at all,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s very
intelligent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who has not seen a cat, when it wishes to go out, raise its
fore paws on to the handle of the door, or as near as it can get,
and look round, evidently asking some one to turn it for
her?&nbsp; Is it reasonable to deny that a reasoning process is
going on in the cat&rsquo;s mind, whereby she connects her wish
with the steps necessary for its fulfilment, and also with
certain invariable symbols which she knows her master or mistress
will interpret?&nbsp; Once, in company with a friend, I watched a
cat playing with a house-fly in the window of a ground-floor
room.&nbsp; We were in the street, while the cat was
inside.&nbsp; When we came up to the window she gave us one
searching look, and, having satisfied herself that we had nothing
for her, went on with her game.&nbsp; She knew all about the
glass in the window, and was sure we could do nothing to molest
her, so she treated us with absolute contempt, never even looking
at us again.</p>
<p>The game was this.&nbsp; She was to catch the fly and roll it
round and round under her paw along the window-sill, but so
gently as not to injure it nor prevent it from being able to fly
again when she had done rolling it.&nbsp; It was very early
spring, and flies were scarce, in fact there was not another in
the whole window.&nbsp; She knew that if she crippled this one,
it would not be able to amuse her further, and that she would not
readily get another instead, and she liked the feel of it under
her paw.&nbsp; It was soft and living, and the quivering of its
wings tickled the ball of her foot in a manner that she found
particularly grateful; so she rolled it gently along the whole
length of the window-sill.&nbsp; It then became the fly&rsquo;s
turn.&nbsp; He was to get up and fly about in the window, so as
to recover himself a little; then she was to catch him again, and
roll him softly all along the window-sill, as she had done
before.</p>
<p>It was plain that the cat knew the rules of her game perfectly
well, and enjoyed it keenly.&nbsp; It was equally plain that the
fly could not make head or tail of what it was all about.&nbsp;
If it had been able to do so it would have gone to play in the
upper part of the window, where the cat could not reach it.&nbsp;
Perhaps it was always hoping to get through the glass, and escape
that way; anyhow, it kept pretty much to the same pane, no matter
how often it was rolled.&nbsp; At last, however, the fly, for
some reason or another, did not reappear on the pane, and the cat
began looking everywhere to find it.&nbsp; Her annoyance when she
failed to do so was extreme.&nbsp; It was not only that she had
lost her fly, but that she could not conceive how she should have
ever come to do so.&nbsp; Presently she noted a small knot in the
woodwork of the sill, and it flashed upon her that she had
accidentally killed the fly, and that this was its dead
body.&nbsp; She tried to move it gently with her paw, but it was
no use, and for the time she satisfied herself that the knot and
the fly had nothing to do with one another.&nbsp; Every now and
then, however, she returned to it as though it were the only
thing she could think of, and she would try it again.&nbsp; She
seemed to say she was certain there had been no knot there
before&mdash;she must have seen it if there had been; and yet,
the fly could hardly have got jammed so firmly into the
wood.&nbsp; She was puzzled and irritated beyond measure, and
kept looking in the same place again and again, just as we do
when we have mislaid something.&nbsp; She was rapidly losing
temper and dignity when suddenly we saw the fly reappear from
under the cat&rsquo;s stomach and make for the window-pane, at
the very moment when the cat herself was exclaiming for the
fiftieth time that she wondered where that stupid fly ever could
have got to.&nbsp; No man who has been hunting twenty minutes for
his spectacles could be more delighted when he suddenly finds
them on his own forehead.&nbsp; &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s where you
were,&rdquo; we seemed to hear her say, as she proceeded to catch
it, and again began rolling it very softly without hurting it,
under her paw.&nbsp; My friend and I both noticed that the cat,
in spite of her perplexity, never so much as hinted that we were
the culprits.&nbsp; The question whether anything outside the
window could do her good or harm had long since been settled by
her in the negative, and she was not going to reopen it; she
simply cut us dead, and though her annoyance was so great that
she was manifestly ready to lay the blame on anybody or anything
with or without reason, and though she must have perfectly well
known that we were watching the whole affair with amusement, she
never either asked us if we had happened to see such a thing as a
fly go down our way lately, or accused us of having taken it from
her&mdash;both of which ideas she would, I am confident, have
been very well able to convey to us if she had been so
minded.</p>
<p>Now what are thought and reason if the processes that were
going through this cat&rsquo;s mind were not both one and the
other?&nbsp; It would be childish to suppose that the cat thought
in words of its own, or in anything like words.&nbsp; Its
thinking was probably conducted through the instrumentality of a
series of mental images.&nbsp; We so habitually think in words
ourselves that we find it difficult to realise thought without
words at all; our difficulty, however, in imagining the
particular manner in which the cat thinks has nothing to do with
the matter.&nbsp; We must answer the question whether she thinks
or no, not according to our own ease or difficulty in
understanding the particular manner of her thinking, but
according as her action does or does not appear to be of the same
character as other action that we commonly call thoughtful.&nbsp;
To say that the cat is not intelligent, merely on the ground that
we cannot ourselves fathom her intelligence&mdash;this, as I have
elsewhere said, is to make intelligence mean the power of being
understood, rather than the power of understanding.&nbsp; This
nevertheless is what, for all our boasted intelligence, we
generally do.&nbsp; The more we can understand an animal&rsquo;s
ways, the more intelligent we call it, and the less we can
understand these, the more stupid do we declare it to be.&nbsp;
As for plants&mdash;whose punctuality and attention to all the
details and routine of their somewhat restricted lines of
business is as obvious as it is beyond all praise&mdash;we
understand the working of their minds so little that by common
consent we declare them to have no intelligence at all.</p>
<p>Before concluding I should wish to deal a little more fully
with Professor Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s contention that there can
be no reason without language, and no language without
reason.&nbsp; Surely when two practised pugilists are fighting,
parrying each other&rsquo;s blows, and watching keenly for an
unguarded point, they are thinking and reasoning very subtly the
whole time, without doing so in words.&nbsp; The machination of
their thoughts, as well as its expression, is actual&mdash;I
mean, effectuated and expressed by action and deed, not
words.&nbsp; They are unaware of any logical sequence of thought
that they could follow in words as passing through their minds at
all.&nbsp; They may perhaps think consciously in words now and
again, but such thought will be intermittent, and the main part
of the fighting will be done without any internal concomitance of
articulated phrases.&nbsp; Yet we cannot doubt that their action,
however much we may disapprove of it, is guided by intelligence
and reason; nor should we doubt that a reasoning process of the
same character goes on in the minds of two dogs or fighting-cocks
when they are striving to master their opponents.</p>
<p>Do we think in words, again, when we wind up our watches, put
on our clothes, or eat our breakfasts?&nbsp; If we do, it is
generally about something else.&nbsp; We do these things almost
as much without the help of words as we wink or yawn, or perform
any of those other actions that we call reflex, as it would
almost seem because they are done without reflection.&nbsp; They
are not, however, the less reasonable because wordless.</p>
<p>Even when we think we are thinking in words, we do so only in
half measure.&nbsp; A running accompaniment of words no doubt
frequently attends our thoughts; but, unless we are writing or
speaking, this accompaniment is of the vaguest and most fitful
kind, as we often find out when we try to write down or say what
we are thinking about, though we have a fairly definite notion of
it, or fancy that we have one, all the time.&nbsp; The thought is
not steadily and coherently governed by and moulded in words, nor
does it steadily govern them.&nbsp; Words and thought interact
upon and help one another, as any other mechanical appliances
interact on and help the invention that first hit upon them; but
reason or thought, for the most part, flies along over the heads
of words, working its own mysterious way in paths that are beyond
our ken, though whether some of our departmental personalities
are as unconscious of what is passing, as that central government
is which we alone dub with the name of &ldquo;we&rdquo; or
&ldquo;us,&rdquo; is a point on which I will not now touch.</p>
<p>I cannot think, then, that Professor Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s
contention that thought and language are identical&mdash;and he
has repeatedly affirmed this&mdash;will ever be generally
accepted.&nbsp; Thought is no more identical with language than
feeling is identical with the nervous system.&nbsp; True, we can
no more feel without a nervous system than we can discern certain
minute organisms without a microscope.&nbsp; Destroy the nervous
system, and we destroy feeling.&nbsp; Destroy the microscope, and
we can no longer see the animalcules; but our sight of the
animalcules is not the microscope, though it is effectuated by
means of the microscope, and our feeling is not the nervous
system, though the nervous system is the instrument that enables
us to feel.</p>
<p>The nervous system is a device which living beings have
gradually perfected&mdash;I believe I may say quite
truly&mdash;through the will and power which they have derived
from a fountain-head, the existence of which we can infer, but
which we can never apprehend.&nbsp; By the help of this device,
and in proportion as they have perfected it, living beings feel
ever with greater definiteness, and hence formulate their
feelings in thought with more and more precision.&nbsp; The
higher evolution of thought has reacted on the nervous system,
and the consequent higher evolution of the nervous system has
again reacted upon thought.&nbsp; These things are as power and
desire, or supply and demand, each one of which is continually
outstripping, and being in turn outstripped by the other; but, in
spite of their close connection and interaction, power is not
desire, nor demand supply.&nbsp; Language is a device evolved
sometimes by leaps and bounds, and sometimes exceedingly slowly,
whereby we help ourselves alike to greater ease, precision, and
complexity of thought, and also to more convenient interchange of
thought among ourselves.&nbsp; Thought found rude expression,
which gradually among other forms assumed that of words.&nbsp;
These reacted upon thought, and thought again on them, but
thought is no more identical with words than words are with the
separate letters of which they are composed.</p>
<p>To sum up, then, and to conclude.&nbsp; I would ask you to see
the connection between words and ideas, as in the first instance
arbitrary.&nbsp; No doubt in some cases an imitation of the cry
of some bird or wild beast would suggest the name that should be
attached to it; occasionally the sound of an operation such as
grinding may have influenced the choice of the letters g, r, as
the root of many words that denote a grinding, grating, grasping,
crushing, action; but I understand that the number of words due
to direct imitation is comparatively few in number, and that they
have been mainly coined as the result of connections so
far-fetched and fanciful as to amount practically to no
connection at all.&nbsp; Once chosen, however, they were adhered
to for a considerable time among the dwellers in any given place,
so as to become acknowledged as the vulgar tongue, and raise
readily in the mind of the inhabitants of that place the ideas
with which they had been artificially associated.</p>
<p>As regards our being able to think and reason without words,
the Duke of Argyll has put the matter as soundly as I have yet
seen it stated.&nbsp; &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; he wrote,
&ldquo;quite certain that we can and do constantly think of
things without thinking of any sound or word as designating
them.&nbsp; Language seems to me to be necessary for the progress
of thought, but not at all for the mere act of thinking.&nbsp; It
is a product of thought, an expression of it, a vehicle for the
communication of it, and an embodiment which is essential to its
growth and continuity; but it seems to me altogether erroneous to
regard it as an inseparable part of cogitation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following passages, again, are quoted from Sir William
Hamilton in Professor Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s own book, with so
much approval as to lead one to suppose that the differences
between himself and his opponents are in reality less than he
believes them to be:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Language,&rdquo; says Sir W. Hamilton, &ldquo;is the
attribution of signs to our cognitions of things.&nbsp; But as a
cognition must have already been there before it could receive a
sign, consequently that knowledge which is denoted by the
formation and application of a word must have preceded the symbol
that denotes it.&nbsp; A sign, however, is necessary to give
stability to our intellectual progress&mdash;to establish each
step in our advance as a new starting-point for our advance to
another beyond.&nbsp; A country may be overrun by an armed host,
but it is only conquered by the establishment of
fortresses.&nbsp; Words are the fortresses of thought.&nbsp; They
enable us to realise our dominion over what we have already
overrun in thought; to make every intellectual conquest the base
of operations for others still beyond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; says Professor Max M&uuml;ller, &ldquo;is
a most happy illustration,&rdquo; and he proceeds to quote the
following, also from Sir William Hamilton, which he declares to
be even happier still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have all heard,&rdquo; says Sir William Hamilton,
&ldquo;of the process of tunnelling through a sandbank.&nbsp; In
this operation it is impossible to succeed unless every foot,
nay, almost every inch of our progress be secured by an arch of
masonry before we attempt the excavation of another.&nbsp; Now
language is to the mind precisely what the arch is to the
tunnel.&nbsp; The power of thinking and the power of excavation
are not dependent on the words in the one case or on the
mason-work in the other; but without these subsidiaries neither
could be carried on beyond its rudimentary commencement.&nbsp;
Though, therefore, we allow that every movement forward in
language must be determined by an antecedent movement forward in
thought, still, unless thought be accompanied at each point of
its evolutions by a corresponding evolution of language, its
further development is arrested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Man has evolved an articulate language, whereas the lower
animals seem to be without one.&nbsp; Man, therefore, has far
outstripped them in reasoning faculty as well as in power of
expression.&nbsp; This, however, does not bar the communications
which the lower animals make to one another from possessing all
the essential characteristics of language, and as a matter of
fact, wherever we can follow them we find such communications
effectuated by the aid of arbitrary symbols covenanted upon by
the living beings that wish to communicate, and persistently
associated with certain corresponding feelings, states of mind,
or material objects.&nbsp; Human language is nothing more than
this in principle, however much further the principle has been
carried in our own case than in that of the lower animals.</p>
<p>This being admitted, we should infer that the thought or
reason on which the language of men and animals is alike founded
differs as between men and brutes in degree but not in
kind.&nbsp; More than this cannot be claimed on behalf of the
lower animals, even by their most enthusiastic admirer.</p>
<h2>THE DEADLOCK IN DARWINISM <a name="citation20"></a><a
href="#footnote20" class="citation">[20]</a>&mdash;PART I</h2>
<p>It will be readily admitted that of all living writers Mr.
Alfred Russel Wallace is the one the peculiar turn of whose mind
best fits him to write on the subject of natural selection, or
the accumulation of fortunate but accidental variations through
descent and the struggle for existence.&nbsp; His mind in all its
more essential characteristics closely resembles that of the late
Mr. Charles Darwin himself, and it is no doubt due to this fact
that he and Mr. Darwin elaborated their famous theory at the same
time, and independently of one another.&nbsp; I shall have
occasion in the course of the following article to show how
misled and misleading both these distinguished men have been, in
spite of their unquestionable familiarity with the whole range of
animal and vegetable phenomena.&nbsp; I believe it will be more
respectful to both of them to do this in the most out-spoken
way.&nbsp; I believe their work to have been as mischievous as it
has been valuable, and as valuable as it has been mischievous;
and higher, whether praise or blame, I know not how to
give.&nbsp; Nevertheless I would in the outset, and with the
utmost sincerity, admit concerning Messrs. Wallace and Darwin
that neither can be held as the more profound and conscientious
thinker; neither can be put forward as the more ready to
acknowledge obligation to the great writers on evolution who had
preceded him, or to place his own developments in closer and more
conspicuous historical connection with earlier thought upon the
subject; neither is the more ready to welcome criticism and to
state his opponent&rsquo;s case in the most pointed and telling
way in which it can be put; neither is the more quick to
encourage new truth; neither is the more genial, generous
adversary, or has the profounder horror of anything even
approaching literary or scientific want of candour; both display
the same inimitable power of putting their opinions forward in
the way that shall best ensure their acceptance; both are equally
unrivalled in the tact that tells them when silence will be
golden, and when on the other hand a whole volume of facts may be
advantageously brought forward.&nbsp; Less than the foregoing
tribute both to Messrs. Darwin and Wallace I will not, and more I
cannot pay.</p>
<p>Let us now turn to the most authoritative exponent of
latter-day evolution&mdash;I mean to Mr. Wallace, whose work,
entitled &ldquo;Darwinism,&rdquo; though it should have been
entitled &ldquo;Wallaceism,&rdquo; is still so far Darwinistic
that it develops the teaching of Mr. Darwin in the direction
given to it by Mr. Darwin himself&mdash;so far, indeed, as this
can be ascertained at all&mdash;and not in that of Lamarck.&nbsp;
Mr. Wallace tells us, on the first page of his preface, that he
has no intention of dealing even in outline with the vast subject
of evolution in general, and has only tried to give such an
account of the theory of natural selection as may facilitate a
clear conception of Darwin&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; How far he has
succeeded is a point on which opinion will probably be
divided.&nbsp; Those who find Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s works clear will
also find no difficulty in understanding Mr. Wallace; those, on
the other hand, who find Mr. Darwin puzzling are little likely to
be less puzzled by Mr. Wallace.&nbsp; He continues:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The objections now made to Darwin&rsquo;s theory apply
solely to the particular means by which the change of species has
been brought about, not to the fact of that change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But &ldquo;Darwin&rsquo;s theory&rdquo;&mdash;as Mr. Wallace
has elsewhere proved that he understands&mdash;has no reference
&ldquo;to the fact of that change&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, to
the fact that species have been modified in course of descent
from other species.&nbsp; This is no more Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
theory than it is the reader&rsquo;s or my own.&nbsp;
Darwin&rsquo;s theory is concerned only with &ldquo;the
particular means by which the change of species has been brought
about&rdquo;; his contention being that this is mainly due to the
natural survival of those individuals that have happened by some
accident to be born most favourably adapted to their
surroundings, or, in other words, through accumulation in the
common course of nature of the more lucky variations that chance
occasionally purveys.&nbsp; Mr. Wallace&rsquo;s words, then, in
reality amount to this, that the objections now made to
Darwin&rsquo;s theory apply solely to Darwin&rsquo;s theory,
which is all very well as far as it goes, but might have been
more easily apprehended if he had simply said, &ldquo;There are
several objections now made to Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
theory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It must be remembered that the passage quoted above occurs on
the first page of a preface dated March 1889, when the writer had
completed his task, and was most fully conversant with his
subject.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it seems indisputable either that he
is still confusing evolution with Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s theory, or
that he does not know when his sentences have point and when they
have none.</p>
<p>I should perhaps explain to some readers that Mr. Darwin did
not modify the main theory put forward, first by Buffon, to whom
it indisputably belongs, and adopted from him by Erasmus Darwin,
Lamarck, and many other writers in the latter half of the last
century and the earlier years of the present.&nbsp; The early
evolutionists maintained that all existing forms of animal and
vegetable life, including man, were derived in course of descent
with modification from forms resembling the lowest now known.</p>
<p>Mr. Darwin went as far as this, and farther no one can
go.&nbsp; The point at issue between him and his predecessors
involves neither the main fact of evolution, nor yet the
geometrical ratio of increase, and the struggle for existence
consequent thereon.&nbsp; Messrs. Darwin and Wallace have each
thrown invaluable light upon these last two points, but Buffon,
as early as 1756, had made them the keystone of his system.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The movement of nature,&rdquo; he then wrote, &ldquo;turns
on two immovable pivots: one, the illimitable fecundity which she
has given to all species: the other, the innumerable difficulties
which reduce the results of that fecundity.&rdquo;&nbsp; Erasmus
Darwin and Lamarck followed in the same sense.&nbsp; They thus
admit the survival of the fittest as fully as Mr. Darwin himself,
though they do not make use of this particular expression.&nbsp;
The dispute turns not upon natural selection, which is common to
all writers on evolution, but upon the nature and causes of the
variations that are supposed to be selected from and thus
accumulated.&nbsp; Are these mainly attributable to the inherited
effects of use and disuse, supplemented by occasional sports and
happy accidents?&nbsp; Or are they mainly due to sports and happy
accidents, supplemented by occasional inherited effects of use
and disuse?</p>
<p>The Lamarckian system has all along been maintained by Mr.
Herbert Spencer, who, in his &ldquo;Principles of Biology,&rdquo;
published in 1865, showed how impossible it was that accidental
variations should accumulate at all.&nbsp; I am not sure how far
Mr. Spencer would consent to being called a Lamarckian pure and
simple, nor yet how far it is strictly accurate to call him one;
nevertheless, I can see no important difference in the main
positions taken by him and by Lamarck.</p>
<p>The question at issue between the Lamarckians, supported by
Mr. Spencer and a growing band of those who have risen in
rebellion against the Charles-Darwinian system on the one hand,
and Messrs. Darwin and Wallace with the greater number of our
more prominent biologists on the other, involves the very
existence of evolution as a workable theory.&nbsp; For it is
plain that what Nature can be supposed able to do by way of
choice must depend on the supply of the variations from which she
is supposed to choose.&nbsp; She cannot take what is not offered
to her; and so again she cannot be supposed able to accumulate
unless what is gained in one direction in one generation, or
series of generations, is little likely to be lost in those that
presently succeed.&nbsp; Now variations ascribed mainly to use
and disuse can be supposed capable of being accumulated, for use
and disuse are fairly constant for long periods among the
individuals of the same species, and often over large areas;
moreover, conditions of existence involving changes of habit, and
thus of organisation, come for the most part gradually; so that
time is given during which the organism can endeavour to adapt
itself in the requisite respects, instead of being shocked out of
existence by too sudden change.&nbsp; Variations, on the other
hand, that are ascribed to mere chance cannot be supposed as
likely to be accumulated, for chance is notoriously inconstant,
and would not purvey the variations in sufficiently unbroken
succession, or in a sufficient number of individuals, modified
similarly in all the necessary correlations at the same time and
place to admit of their being accumulated.&nbsp; It is vital
therefore to the theory of evolution, as was early pointed out by
the late Professor Fleeming Jenkin and by Mr. Herbert Spencer,
that variations should be supposed to have a definite and
persistent principle underlying them, which shall tend to
engender similar and simultaneous modification, however small, in
the vast majority of individuals composing any species.&nbsp; The
existence of such a principle and its permanence is the only
thing that can be supposed capable of acting as rudder and
compass to the accumulation of variations, and of making it hold
steadily on one course for each species, till eventually many
havens, far remote from one another, are safely reached.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the having fatally impaired the theory of
his predecessors could not warrant Mr. Darwin in claiming, as he
most fatuously did, the theory of evolution.&nbsp; That he is
still generally believed to have been the originator of this
theory is due to the fact that he claimed it, and that a powerful
literary backing at once came forward to support him.&nbsp; It
seems at first sight improbable that those who too zealously
urged his claims were unaware that so much had been written on
the subject, but when we find even Mr. Wallace himself as
profoundly ignorant on this subject as he still either is, or
affects to be, there is no limit assignable to the ignorance or
affected ignorance of the kind of biologists who would write
reviews in leading journals thirty years ago.&nbsp; Mr. Wallace
writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few great naturalists, struck by the very slight
difference between many of these species, and the numerous links
that exist between the most different forms of animals and
plants, and also observing that a great many species do vary
considerably in their forms, colours and habits, conceived the
idea that they might be all produced one from the other.&nbsp;
The most eminent of these writers was a great French naturalist,
Lamarck, who published an elaborate work, the <i>Philosophie
Zoologique</i>, in which he endeavoured to prove that all animals
whatever are descended from other species of animals.&nbsp; He
attributed the change of species chiefly to the effect of changes
in the conditions of life&mdash;such as climate, food, &amp;c.;
and especially to the desires and efforts of the animals
themselves to improve their condition, leading to a modification
of form or size in certain parts, owing to the well-known
physiological law that all organs are strengthened by constant
use, while they are weakened or even completely lost by disuse .
. .</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only other important work dealing with the question
was the celebrated &lsquo;Vestiges of Creation,&rsquo; published
anonymously, but now acknowledged to have been written by the
late Robert Chambers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>None are so blind as those who will not see, and it would be
waste of time to argue with the invincible ignorance of one who
thinks Lamarck and Buffon conceived that all species were
produced from one another, more especially as I have already
dealt at some length with the early evolutionists in my work,
&ldquo;Evolution, Old and New,&rdquo; first published ten years
ago, and not, so far as I am aware, detected in serious error or
omission.&nbsp; If, however, Mr. Wallace still thinks it safe to
presume so far on the ignorance of his readers as to say that the
only two important works on evolution before Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
were Lamarck&rsquo;s <i>Philosophie Zoologique</i> and the
&ldquo;Vestiges of Creation,&rdquo; how fathomable is the
ignorance of the average reviewer likely to have been thirty
years ago, when the &ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; was first
published?&nbsp; Mr. Darwin claimed evolution as his own
theory.&nbsp; Of course, he would not claim it if he had no right
to it.&nbsp; Then by all means give him the credit of it.&nbsp;
This was the most natural view to take, and it was generally
taken.&nbsp; It was not, moreover, surprising that people failed
to appreciate all the niceties of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
&ldquo;distinctive feature&rdquo; which, whether distinctive or
no, was assuredly not distinct, and was never frankly contrasted
with the older view, as it would have been by one who wished it
to be understood and judge upon its merits.&nbsp; It was in
consequence of this omission that people failed to note how fast
and loose Mr. Darwin played with his distinctive feature, and how
readily he dropped it on occasion.</p>
<p>It may be said that the question of what was thought by the
predecessors of Mr. Darwin is, after all, personal, and of no
interest to the general public, comparable to that of the main
issue&mdash;whether we are to accept evolution or not.&nbsp;
Granted that Buffon, Erasmus Darwin, and Lamarck bore the burden
and heat of the day before Mr. Charles Darwin was born, they did
not bring people round to their opinion, whereas Mr. Darwin and
Mr. Wallace did, and the public cannot be expected to look beyond
this broad and indisputable fact.</p>
<p>The answer to this is, that the theory which Messrs. Darwin
and Wallace have persuaded the public to accept is demonstrably
false, and that the opponents of evolution are certain in the end
to triumph over it.&nbsp; Paley, in his &ldquo;Natural
Theology,&rdquo; long since brought forward far too much evidence
of design in animal organisation to allow of our setting down its
marvels to the accumulations of fortunate accident, undirected by
will, effort and intelligence.&nbsp; Those who examine the main
facts of animal and vegetable organisation without bias will, no
doubt, ere long conclude that all animals and vegetables are
derived ultimately from unicellular organisms, but they will not
less readily perceive that the evolution of species without the
concomitance and direction of mind and effort is as inconceivable
as is the independent creation of every individual species.&nbsp;
The two facts, evolution and design, are equally patent to plain
people.&nbsp; There is no escaping from either.&nbsp; According
to Messrs. Darwin and Wallace, we may have evolution, but are on
no account to have it as mainly due to intelligent effort, guided
by ever higher and higher range of sensations, perceptions, and
ideas.&nbsp; We are to set it down to the shuffling of cards, or
the throwing of dice without the play, and this will never
stand.</p>
<p>According to the older men, cards did indeed count for much,
but play counted for more.&nbsp; They denied the teleology of the
time&mdash;that is to say, the teleology that saw all adaptation
to surroundings as part of a plan devised long ages since by a
quasi-anthropomorphic being who schemed everything out much as a
man would do, but on an infinitely vaster scale.&nbsp; This
conception they found repugnant alike to intelligence and
conscience, but, though they do not seem to have perceived it,
they left the door open for a design more true and more
demonstrable than that which they excluded.&nbsp; By making their
variations mainly due to effort and intelligence, they made
organic development run on all-fours with human progress, and
with inventions which we have watched growing up from small
beginnings.&nbsp; They made the development of man from the
amoeba part and parcel of the story that may be read, though on
an infinitely smaller scale, in the development of our most
powerful marine engines from the common kettle, or of our finest
microscopes from the dew-drop.</p>
<p>The development of the steam-engine and the microscope is due
to intelligence and design, which did indeed utilise chance
suggestions, but which improved on these, and directed each step
of their accumulation, though never foreseeing more than a step
or two ahead, and often not so much as this.&nbsp; The fact, as I
have elsewhere urged, that the man who made the first kettle did
not foresee the engines of the <i>Great Eastern</i>, or that he
who first noted the magnifying power of the dew-drop had no
conception of our present microscopes&mdash;the very limited
amount, in fact, of design and intelligence that was called into
play at any one point&mdash;this does not make us deny that the
steam-engine and microscope owe their development to
design.&nbsp; If each step of the road was designed, the whole
journey was designed, though the particular end was not designed
when the journey was begun.&nbsp; And so is it, according to the
older view of evolution, with the development of those living
organs, or machines, that are born with us, as part of the
perambulating carpenter&rsquo;s chest we call our bodies.&nbsp;
The older view gives us our design, and gives us our evolution
too.&nbsp; If it refuses to see a quasi-anthropomorphic God
modelling each species from without as a potter models clay, it
gives us God as vivifying and indwelling in all His
creatures&mdash;He in them, and they in Him.&nbsp; If it refuses
to see God outside the universe, it equally refuses to see any
part of the universe as outside God.&nbsp; If it makes the
universe the body of God, it also makes God the soul of the
universe.&nbsp; The question at issue, then, between the
Darwinism of Erasmus Darwin and the neo-Darwinism of his
grandson, is not a personal one, nor anything like a personal
one.&nbsp; It not only involves the existence of evolution, but
it affects the view we take of life and things in an endless
variety of most interesting and important ways.&nbsp; It is
imperative, therefore, on those who take any interest in these
matters, to place side by side in the clearest contrast the views
of those who refer the evolution of species mainly to
accumulation of variations that have no other inception than
chance, and of that older school which makes design perceive and
develop still further the goods that chance provides.</p>
<p>But over and above this, which would be in itself sufficient,
the historical mode of studying any question is the only one
which will enable us to comprehend it effectually.&nbsp; The
personal element cannot be eliminated from the consideration of
works written by living persons for living persons.&nbsp; We want
to know who is who&mdash;whom we can depend upon to have no other
end than the making things clear to himself and his readers, and
whom we should mistrust as having an ulterior aim on which he is
more intent than on the furthering of our better
understanding.&nbsp; We want to know who is doing his best to
help us, and who is only trying to make us help him, or to
bolster up the system in which his interests are vested.&nbsp;
There is nothing that will throw more light upon these points
than the way in which a man behaves towards those who have worked
in the same field with himself, and, again, than his style.&nbsp;
A man&rsquo;s style, as Buffon long since said, is the man
himself.&nbsp; By style, I do not, of course, mean grammar or
rhetoric, but that style of which Buffon again said that it is
like happiness, and <i>vient de la douceur de
l&rsquo;&acirc;me</i>.&nbsp; When we find a man concealing worse
than nullity of meaning under sentences that sound plausibly
enough, we should distrust him much as we should a
fellow-traveller whom we caught trying to steal our watch.&nbsp;
We often cannot judge of the truth or falsehood of facts for
ourselves, but we most of us know enough of human nature to be
able to tell a good witness from a bad one.</p>
<p>However this may be, and whatever we may think of judging
systems by the directness or indirectness of those who advance
them, biologists, having committed themselves too rashly, would
have been more than human if they had not shown some pique
towards those who dared to say, first, that the theory of Messrs.
Darwin and Wallace was unworkable; and secondly, that even though
it were workable it would not justify either of them in claiming
evolution.&nbsp; When biologists show pique at all they generally
show a good deal of pique, but pique or no pique, they shunned
Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s objection above referred to with a
persistency more unanimous and obstinate than I ever remember to
have seen displayed even by professional truth-seekers.&nbsp; I
find no rejoinder to it from Mr. Darwin himself, between 1865
when it was first put forward, and 1882 when Mr. Darwin
died.&nbsp; It has been similarly &ldquo;ostrichised&rdquo; by
all the leading apologists of Darwinism, so far at least as I
have been able to observe, and I have followed the matter closely
for many years.&nbsp; Mr. Spencer has repeated and amplified it
in his recent work, &ldquo;The Factors of Organic
Evolution,&rdquo; but it still remains without so much as an
attempt at serious answer, for the perfunctory and illusory
remarks of Mr. Wallace at the end of his &ldquo;Darwinism&rdquo;
cannot be counted as such.&nbsp; The best proof of its
irresistible weight is that Mr. Darwin, though maintaining
silence in respect to it, retreated from his original position in
the direction that would most obviate Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s
objection.</p>
<p>Yet this objection has been repeatedly urged by the more
prominent anti-Charles-Darwinian authorities, and there is no
sign that the British public is becoming less rigorous in
requiring people either to reply to objections repeatedly urged
by men of even moderate weight, or to let judgment go by
default.&nbsp; As regards Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s claim to the theory
of evolution generally, Darwinians are beginning now to perceive
that this cannot be admitted, and either say with some hardihood
that Mr. Darwin never claimed it, or after a few saving clauses
to the effect that this theory refers only to the particular
means by which evolution has been brought about, imply forthwith
thereafter none the less that evolution is Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
theory.&nbsp; Mr. Wallace has done this repeatedly in his recent
&ldquo;Darwinism.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed, I should be by no means
sure that on the first page of his preface, in the passage about
&ldquo;Darwin&rsquo;s theory,&rdquo; which I have already
somewhat severely criticised, he was not intending evolution by
&ldquo;Darwin&rsquo;s theory,&rdquo; if in his preceding
paragraph he had not so clearly shown that he knew evolution to
be a theory of greatly older date than Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The history of science&mdash;well exemplified by that of the
development theory&mdash;is the history of eminent men who have
fought against light and have been worsted.&nbsp; The tenacity
with which Darwinians stick to their accumulation of fortuitous
variations is on a par with the like tenacity shown by the
illustrious Cuvier, who did his best to crush evolution
altogether.&nbsp; It always has been thus, and always will be;
nor is it desirable in the interests of Truth herself that it
should be otherwise.&nbsp; Truth is like money&mdash;lightly
come, lightly go; and if she cannot hold her own against even
gross misrepresentation, she is herself not worth holding.&nbsp;
Misrepresentation in the long run makes Truth as much as it mars
her; hence our law courts do not think it desirable that pleaders
should speak their <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> opinions, much less
that they should profess to do so.&nbsp; Rather let each side
hoodwink judge and jury as best it can, and let truth flash out
from collision of defence and accusation.&nbsp; When either side
will not collide, it is an axiom of controversy that it desires
to prevent the truth from being elicited.</p>
<p>Let us now note the courses forced upon biologists by the
difficulties of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s distinctive feature.&nbsp; Mr.
Darwin and Mr. Wallace, as is well known, brought the feature
forward simultaneously and independently of one another, but Mr.
Wallace always believed in it more firmly than Mr. Darwin
did.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin as a young man did not believe in it.&nbsp;
He wrote before 1889, &ldquo;Nature, by making habit omnipotent
and its effects hereditary, has fitted the Fuegian for the
climate and productions of his country,&rdquo; <a
name="citation21"></a><a href="#footnote21"
class="citation">[21]</a> a sentence than which nothing can
coincide more fully with the older view that use and disuse were
the main purveyors of variations, or conflict more fatally with
his own subsequent distinctive feature.&nbsp; Moreover, as I
showed in my last work on evolution, <a name="citation22"></a><a
href="#footnote22" class="citation">[22]</a> in the peroration to
his &ldquo;Origin of Species,&rdquo; he discarded his accidental
variations altogether, and fell back on the older theory, so that
the body of the &ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; supports one
theory, and the peroration another that differs from it <i>toto
c&oelig;lo</i>.&nbsp; Finally, in his later editions, he
retreated indefinitely from his original position, edging always
more and more continually towards the theory of his grandfather
and Lamarck.&nbsp; These facts convince me that he was at no time
a thorough-going Darwinian, but was throughout an unconscious
Lamarckian, though ever anxious to conceal the fact alike from
himself and from his readers.</p>
<p>Not so with Mr. Wallace, who was both more outspoken in the
first instance, and who has persevered along the path of
Wallaceism just as Mr. Darwin with greater sagacity was ever on
the retreat from Darwinism.&nbsp; Mr. Wallace&rsquo;s profounder
faith led him in the outset to place his theory in fuller
daylight than Mr. Darwin was inclined to do.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin
just waved Lamarck aside, and said as little about him as he
could, while in his earlier editions Erasmus Darwin and Buffon
were not so much as named.&nbsp; Mr. Wallace, on the contrary, at
once raised the Lamarckian spectre, and declared it
exorcised.&nbsp; He said the Lamarckian hypothesis was
&ldquo;quite unnecessary.&rdquo;&nbsp; The giraffe did not
&ldquo;acquire its long neck by desiring to reach the foliage of
the more lofty shrubs, and constantly stretching its neck for
this purpose, but because any varieties which occurred among its
antitypes with a longer neck than usual at once secured a fresh
range of pasture over the same ground as their shorter-necked
companions, and on the first scarcity of food were thus enabled
to outlive them.&rdquo; <a name="citation23"></a><a
href="#footnote23" class="citation">[23]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Which occurred&rdquo; is evidently &ldquo;which
happened to occur&rdquo; by some chance or accident unconnected
with use and disuse.&nbsp; The word &ldquo;accident&rdquo; is
never used, but Mr. Wallace must be credited with this instance
of a desire to give his readers a chance of perceiving that
according to his distinctive feature evolution is an affair of
luck, rather than of cunning.&nbsp; Whether his readers actually
did understand this as clearly as Mr. Wallace doubtless desired
that they should, and whether greater development at this point
would not have helped them to fuller apprehension, we need not
now inquire.&nbsp; What was gained in distinctness might have
been lost in distinctiveness, and after all he did technically
put us upon our guard.</p>
<p>Nevertheless he too at a pinch takes refuge in
Lamarckism.&nbsp; In relation to the manner in which the eyes of
soles, turbots, and other flat-fish travel round the head so as
to become in the end unsymmetrically placed, he says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The eyes of these fish are curiously distorted in order
that both eyes may be upon the upper side, where alone they would
be of any use. . . . Now if we suppose this process, which in the
young is completed in a few days or weeks, to have been spread
over thousands of generations during the development of these
fish, those usually surviving <i>whose eyes retained more and
more of the position into which the young fish tried to twist
them</i> [italics mine], the change becomes intelligible.&rdquo;
<a name="citation24"></a><a href="#footnote24"
class="citation">[24]</a>&nbsp; When it was said by Professor Ray
Lankester&mdash;who knows as well as most people what Lamarck
taught&mdash;that this was &ldquo;flat Lamarckism,&rdquo; Mr.
Wallace rejoined that it was the survival of the modified
individuals that did it all, not the efforts of the young fish to
twist their eyes, and the transmission to descendants of the
effects of those efforts.&nbsp; But this, as I said in my book,
&ldquo;Evolution, Old and New,&rdquo; <a name="citation25"></a><a
href="#footnote25" class="citation">[25]</a> is like saying that
horses are swift runners, not by reason of the causes, whatever
they were, that occasioned the direct line of their progenitors
to vary towards ever greater and greater swiftness, but because
their more slow-going uncles and aunts go away.&nbsp; Plain
people will prefer to say that the main cause of any accumulation
of favourable modifications consists rather in that which brings
about the initial variations, and in the fact that these can be
inherited at all, than in the fact that the unmodified
individuals were not successful.&nbsp; People do not become rich
because the poor in large numbers go away, but because they have
been lucky, or provident, or more commonly both.&nbsp; If they
would keep their wealth when they have made it they must exclude
luck thenceforth to the utmost of their power, and their children
must follow their example, or they will soon lose their
money.&nbsp; The fact that the weaker go to the wall does not
bring about the greater strength of the stronger; it is the
consequence of this last and not the cause&mdash;unless, indeed,
it be contended that a knowledge that the weak go to the wall
stimulates the strong to exertions which they would not otherwise
so make, and that these exertions produce inheritable
modifications.&nbsp; Even in this case, however, it would be the
exertions, or use and disuse, that would be the main agents in
the modification.&nbsp; But it is not often that Mr. Wallace thus
backslides.&nbsp; His present position is that acquired (as
distinguished from congenital) modifications are not inherited at
all.&nbsp; He does not indeed put his faith prominently forward
and pin himself to it as plainly as could be wished, but under
the heading, &ldquo;The Non-Heredity of Acquired
Characters,&rdquo; he writes as follows on p. 440 of his recent
work in reference to Professor Weismann&rsquo;s Theory of
Heredity:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certain observations on the embryology of the lower
animals are held to afford direct proof of this theory of
heredity, but they are too technical to be made clear to ordinary
readers.&nbsp; A logical result of the theory is the
impossibility of the transmission of acquired characters, since
the molecular structure of the germ-plasm is already determined
within the embryo; and Weismann holds that there are no facts
which really prove that acquired characters can be inherited,
although their inheritance has, by most writers, been considered
so probable as hardly to stand in need of direct proof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have already seen in the earlier part of this
chapter that many instances of change, imputed to the inheritance
of acquired variations, are really cases of selection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the rest of the remarks tend to convey the impression that
Mr. Wallace adopts Professor Weismann&rsquo;s view, but,
curiously enough, though I have gone through Mr. Wallace&rsquo;s
book with a special view to this particular point, I have not
been able to find him definitely committing himself either to the
assertion that acquired modifications never are inherited, or
that they sometimes are so.&nbsp; It is abundantly laid down that
Mr. Darwin laid too much stress on use and disuse, and a
residuary impression is left that Mr. Wallace is endorsing
Professor Weismann&rsquo;s view, but I have found it impossible
to collect anything that enables me to define his position
confidently in this respect.</p>
<p>This is natural enough, for Mr. Wallace has entitled his book
&ldquo;Darwinism,&rdquo; and a work denying that use and disuse
produced any effect could not conceivably be called
Darwinism.&nbsp; Mr. Herbert Spencer has recently collected many
passages from &ldquo;The Origin of Species&rdquo; and from
&ldquo;Animals and Plants under Domestication,&rdquo; <a
name="citation26"></a><a href="#footnote26"
class="citation">[26]</a> which show how largely, after all, use
and disuse entered into Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s system, and we know
that in his later years he attached still more importance to
them.&nbsp; It was out of the question, therefore, that Mr.
Wallace should categorically deny that their effects were
inheritable.&nbsp; On the other hand, the temptation to adopt
Professor Weismann&rsquo;s view must have been overwhelming to
one who had been already inclined to minimise the effects of use
and disuse.&nbsp; On the whole, one does not see what Mr. Wallace
could do, other than what he has done&mdash;unless, of course, he
changed his title, or had been no longer Mr. Wallace.</p>
<p>Besides, thanks to the works of Mr. Spencer, Professor Mivart,
Professor Semper, and very many others, there has for some time
been a growing perception that the Darwinism of Charles Darwin
was doomed.&nbsp; Use and disuse must either do even more than is
officially recognised in Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s later concessions, or
they must do a great deal less.&nbsp; If they can do as much as
Mr. Darwin himself said they did, why should they not do
more?&nbsp; Why stop where Mr. Darwin did?&nbsp; And again, where
in the name of all that is reasonable did he really stop?&nbsp;
He drew no line, and on what principle can we say that so much is
possible as effect of use and disuse, but so much more
impossible?&nbsp; If, as Mr. Darwin contended, disuse can so far
reduce an organ as to render it rudimentary, and in many cases
get rid of it altogether, why cannot use create as much as disuse
can destroy, provided it has anything, no matter how low in
structure, to begin with?&nbsp; Let us know where we stand.&nbsp;
If it is admitted that use and disuse can do a good deal, what
does a good deal mean?&nbsp; And what is the proportion between
the shares attributable to use and disuse and to natural
selection respectively?&nbsp; If we cannot be told with absolute
precision, let us at any rate have something more definite than
the statement that natural selection is &ldquo;the most important
means of modification.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Darwin gave us no help in this respect; and worse than
this, he contradicted himself so flatly as to show that he had
very little definite idea upon the subject at all.&nbsp; Thus in
respect to the winglessness of the Madeira beetles he
wrote:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In some cases we might easily put down to disuse
modifications of structure, which are wholly or mainly due to
natural selection.&nbsp; Mr. Wollaston has discovered the
remarkable fact that 200 beetles, out of the 550 species (but
more are now known) inhabiting Madeira, are so far deficient in
wings that they cannot fly; and that of the 29 endemic genera no
less than 23 have all their species in this condition!&nbsp;
Several facts,&mdash;namely, that beetles in many parts of the
world are frequently blown out to sea and perish; that the
beetles in Madeira, as observed by Mr. Wollaston, lie much
concealed until the wind lulls and the sun shines; that the
proportion of wingless beetles is larger on the exposed Desertas
than in Madeira itself; and especially the extraordinary fact, so
strongly insisted on by Mr. Wollaston, that certain large groups
of beetles, elsewhere excessively numerous, which absolutely
require the use of their wings are here almost entirely
absent;&mdash;these several considerations make me believe that
the wingless condition of so many Madeira beetles is mainly due
to the action of natural selection, <i>combined probably with
disuse</i> [italics mine].&nbsp; For during many successive
generations each individual beetle which flew least, either from
its wings having been ever so little less perfectly developed or
from indolent habit, will have had the best chance of surviving,
from not being blown out to sea; and, on the other hand, those
beetles which most readily took to flight would oftenest have
been blown to sea, and thus destroyed.&rdquo; <a
name="citation27"></a><a href="#footnote27"
class="citation">[27]</a></p>
<p>We should like to know, first, somewhere about how much disuse
was able to do after all, and moreover why, if it can do anything
at all, it should not be able to do all.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin says:
&ldquo;Any change in structure and function which can be effected
by small stages is within the power of natural
selection.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And why not,&rdquo; we ask,
&ldquo;within the power of use and disuse?&rdquo;&nbsp; Moreover,
on a later page we find Mr. Darwin saying:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>It appears probable that disuse has been the main
agent in rendering organs rudimentary</i> [italics mine].&nbsp;
It would at first lead by slow steps to the more and more
complete reduction of a part, until at last it has become
rudimentary&mdash;as in the case of the eyes of animals
inhabiting dark caverns, and of the wings of birds inhabiting
oceanic islands, which have seldom been forced by beasts of prey
to take flight, and have ultimately lost the power of
flying.&nbsp; Again, an organ, useful under certain conditions,
might become injurious under others, <i>as with the wings of
beetles living on small and exposed islands</i>; and in this case
natural selection will have aided in reducing the organ, until it
was rendered harmless and rudimentary [italics mine].&rdquo; <a
name="citation28"></a><a href="#footnote28"
class="citation">[28]</a></p>
<p>So that just as an undefined amount of use and disuse was
introduced on the earlier page to supplement the effects of
natural selection in respect of the wings of beetles on small and
exposed islands, we have here an undefined amount of natural
selection introduced to supplement the effects of use and disuse
in respect of the identical phenomena.&nbsp; In the one passage
we find that natural selection has been the main agent in
reducing the wings, though use and disuse have had an appreciable
share in the result; in the other, it is use and disuse that have
been the main agents, though an appreciable share in the result
must be ascribed to natural selection.</p>
<p>Besides, who has seen the uncles and aunts going away with the
uniformity that is necessary for Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
contention?&nbsp; We know that birds and insects do often get
blown out to sea and perish, but in order to establish Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s position we want the evidence of those who watched
the reduction of the wings during the many generations in the
course of which it was being effected, and who can testify that
all, or the overwhelming majority, of the beetles born with
fairly well-developed wings got blown out to sea, while those
alone survived whose wings were congenitally degenerate.&nbsp;
Who saw them go, or can point to analogous cases so conclusive as
to compel assent from any equitable thinker?</p>
<p>Darwinians of the stamp of Mr. Thiselton Dyer, Professor Ray
Lankester, or Mr. Romanes, insist on their pound of flesh in the
matter of irrefragable demonstration.&nbsp; They complain of us
for not bringing forward some one who has been able to detect the
movement of the hour-hand of a watch during a second of time, and
when we fail to do so, declare triumphantly that we have no
evidence that there is any connection between the beating of a
second and the movement of the hour-hand.&nbsp; When we say that
rain comes from the condensation of moisture in the atmosphere,
they demand of us a rain-drop from moisture not yet
condensed.&nbsp; If they stickle for proof and cavil on the ninth
part of a hair, as they do when we bring forward what we deem
excellent instances of the transmission of an acquired
characteristic, why may not we, too, demand at any rate some
evidence that the unmodified beetles actually did always, or
nearly always, get blown out to sea, during the reduction above
referred to, and that it is to this fact, and not to the masterly
inactivity of their fathers and mothers, that the Madeira beetles
owe their winglessness?&nbsp; If we began stickling for proof in
this way, our opponents would not be long in letting us know that
absolute proof is unattainable on any subject, that reasonable
presumption is our highest certainty, and that crying out for too
much evidence is as bad as accepting too little.&nbsp; Truth is
like a photographic sensitised plate, which is equally ruined by
over and by under exposure, and the just exposure for which can
never be absolutely determined.</p>
<p>Surely if disuse can be credited with the vast powers involved
in Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s statement that it has probably &ldquo;been
the main agent in rendering organs rudimentary,&rdquo; no limits
are assignable to the accumulated effects of habit, provided the
effects of habit, or use and disuse, are supposed, as Mr. Darwin
supposed them, to be inheritable at all.&nbsp; Darwinians have at
length woke up to the dilemma in which they are placed by the
manner in which Mr. Darwin tried to sit on the two stools of use
and disuse, and natural selection of accidental variations, at
the same time.&nbsp; The knell of Charles-Darwinism is rung in
Mr. Wallace&rsquo;s present book, and in the general perception
on the part of biologists that we must either assign to use and
disuse such a predominant share in modification as to make it the
feature most proper to be insisted on, or deny that the
modifications, whether of mind or body, acquired during a single
lifetime, are ever transmitted at all.&nbsp; If they can be
inherited at all, they can be accumulated.&nbsp; If they can be
accumulated at all, they can be so, for anything that appears to
the contrary, to the extent of the specific and generic
differences with which we are surrounded.&nbsp; The only thing to
do is to pluck them out root and branch: they are as a cancer
which, if the smallest fibre be left unexcised, will grow again,
and kill any system on to which it is allowed to fasten.&nbsp;
Mr. Wallace, therefore, may well be excused if he casts longing
eyes towards Weismannism.</p>
<p>And what was Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s system?&nbsp; Who can make
head or tail of the inextricable muddle in which he left
it?&nbsp; The &ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; in its latest shape
is the reduction of hedging to an absurdity.&nbsp; How did Mr.
Darwin himself leave it in the last chapter of the last edition
of the &ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo;?&nbsp; He
wrote:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have now recapitulated the facts and considerations
which have thoroughly convinced me that species have been
modified during a long course of descent.&nbsp; This has been
effected chiefly through the natural selection of numerous,
successive, slight, favourable variations; aided in an important
manner by the inherited effects of the use and disuse of parts,
and in an unimportant manner&mdash;that is, in relation to
adaptive structures whether past or present&mdash;by the direct
action of external conditions, and by variations which seem to us
in our ignorance to arise spontaneously.&nbsp; It appears that I
formerly underrated the frequency and value of these latter forms
of variation, as leading to permanent modifications of structure
independently of natural selection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;numerous, successive, slight, favourable
variations&rdquo; above referred to are intended to be
fortuitous, accidental, spontaneous.&nbsp; It is the essence of
Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s theory that this should be so.&nbsp; Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s solemn statement, therefore, of his theory, after
he had done his best or his worst with it, is, when stripped of
surplusage, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The modification of species has been mainly effected by
accumulation of spontaneous variations; it has been aided in an
important manner by accumulation of variations due to use and
disuse, and in an unimportant manner by spontaneous variations; I
do not even now think that spontaneous variations have been very
important, but I used once to think them less important than I do
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a discouraging symptom of the age that such a system
should have been so long belauded, and it is a sign of returning
intelligence that even he who has been more especially the
<i>alter ego</i> of Mr. Darwin should have felt constrained to
close the chapter of Charles-Darwinism as a living theory, and
relegate it to the important but not very creditable place in
history which it must henceforth occupy.&nbsp; It is astonishing,
however, that Mr. Wallace should have quoted the extract from the
&ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; just given, as he has done on p.
412 of his &ldquo;Darwinism,&rdquo; without betraying any sign
that he has caught its driftlessness&mdash;for drift, other than
a desire to hedge, it assuredly has not got.&nbsp; The battle now
turns on the question whether modifications of either structure
or instinct due to use or disuse are ever inherited, or whether
they are not.&nbsp; Can the effects of habit be transmitted to
progeny at all?&nbsp; We know that more usually they are not
transmitted to any perceptible extent, but we believe also that
occasionally, and indeed not infrequently, they are inherited and
even intensified.&nbsp; What are our grounds for this
opinion?&nbsp; It will be my object to put these forward in the
following number of the <i>Universal Review</i>.</p>
<h3>THE DEADLOCK IN DARWINISM&mdash;PART II <a
name="citation29"></a><a href="#footnote29"
class="citation">[29]</a></h3>
<p>At the close of my article in last month&rsquo;s number of the
<i>Universal Review</i>, I said I would in this month&rsquo;s
issue show why the opponents of Charles-Darwinism believe the
effects of habits acquired during the lifetime of a parent to
produce an effect on their subsequent offspring, in spite of the
fact that we can rarely find the effect in any one generation, or
even in several, sufficiently marked to arrest our attention.</p>
<p>I will now show that offspring can be, and not very
infrequently is, affected by occurrences that have produced a
deep impression on the parent organism&mdash;the effect produced
on the offspring being such as leaves no doubt that it is to be
connected with the impression produced on the parent.&nbsp;
Having thus established the general proposition, I will proceed
to the more particular one&mdash;that habits, involving use and
disuse of special organs, with the modifications of structure
thereby engendered, produce also an effect upon offspring, which,
though seldom perceptible as regards structure in a single, or
even in several generations, is nevertheless capable of being
accumulated in successive generations till it amounts to specific
and generic difference.&nbsp; I have found the first point as
much as I can treat within the limits of this present article,
and will avail myself of the hospitality of the <i>Universal
Review</i> next month to deal with the second.</p>
<p>The proposition which I have to defend is one which no one
till recently would have questioned, and even now, those who look
most askance at it do not venture to dispute it unreservedly;
they every now and then admit it as conceivable, and even in some
cases probable; nevertheless they seek to minimise it, and to
make out that there is little or no connection between the great
mass of the cells of which the body is composed, and those cells
that are alone capable of reproducing the entire organism.&nbsp;
The tendency is to assign to these last a life of their own,
apart from, and unconnected with that of the other cells of the
body, and to cheapen all evidence that tends to prove any
response on their part to the past history of the individual, and
hence ultimately of the race.</p>
<p>Professor Weismann is the foremost exponent of those who take
this line.&nbsp; He has naturally been welcomed by English
Charles-Darwinians; for if his view can be sustained, then it can
be contended that use and disuse produce no transmissible effect,
and the ground is cut from under Lamarck&rsquo;s feet; if, on the
other hand, his view is unfounded, the Lamarckian reaction,
already strong, will gain still further strength.&nbsp; The
issue, therefore, is important, and is being fiercely contested
by those who have invested their all of reputation for
discernment in Charles-Darwinian securities.</p>
<p>Professor Weismann&rsquo;s theory is, that at every new birth
a part of the substance which proceeds from parents and which
goes to form the new embryo is not used up in forming the new
animal, but remains apart to generate the germ-cells&mdash;or
perhaps I should say &ldquo;germ-plasm&rdquo;&mdash;which the new
animal itself will in due course issue.</p>
<p>Contrasting the generally received view with his own,
Professor Weismann says that according to the first of these
&ldquo;the organism produces germ-cells afresh again and again,
and that it produces them entirely from its own
substance.&rdquo;&nbsp; While by the second &ldquo;the germ-cells
are no longer looked upon as the product of the parent&rsquo;s
body, at least as far as their essential part&mdash;the specific
germ-plasm&mdash;is concerned; they are rather considered as
something which is to be placed in contrast with the <i>tout
ensemble</i> of the cells which make up the parent&rsquo;s body,
and the germ-cells of succeeding generations stand in a similar
relation to one another as a series of generations of unicellular
organisms arising by a continued process of cell-division.&rdquo;
<a name="citation30"></a><a href="#footnote30"
class="citation">[30]</a></p>
<p>On another page he writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that heredity depends upon the fact that a
small portion of the effective substance of the germ, the
germ-plasm, remains unchanged during the development of the ovum
into an organism, and that this part of the germ-plasm serves as
a foundation from which the germ-cells of the new organism are
produced.&nbsp; There is, therefore, continuity of the germ-plasm
from one generation to another.&nbsp; One might represent the
germ-plasm by the metaphor of a long creeping root-stock from
which plants arise at intervals, these latter representing the
individuals of successive generations.&rdquo; <a
name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31"
class="citation">[31]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Wallace, who does not appear to have read Professor
Weismann&rsquo;s essays themselves, but whose remarks are, no
doubt, ultimately derived from the sequel to the passage just
quoted from page 266 of Professor Weismann&rsquo;s book, contends
that the impossibility of the transmission of acquired characters
follows as a logical result from Professor Weismann&rsquo;s
theory, inasmuch as the molecular structure of the germ-plasm
that will go to form any succeeding generation is already
predetermined within the still unformed embryo of its
predecessor; &ldquo;and Weismann,&rdquo; continues Mr. Wallace,
&ldquo;holds that there are no facts which really prove that
acquired characters can be inherited, although their inheritance
has, by most writers, been considered so probable as hardly to
stand in need of direct proof.&rdquo; <a name="citation32"></a><a
href="#footnote32" class="citation">[32]</a></p>
<p>Professor Weismann, in passages too numerous to quote, shows
that he recognises this necessity, and acknowledges that the
non-transmission of acquired characters &ldquo;forms the
foundation of the views&rdquo; set forth in his book, p. 291.</p>
<p>Professor Ray Lankester does not commit himself absolutely to
this view, but lends it support by saying (<i>Nature</i>,
December 12, 1889): &ldquo;It is hardly necessary to say that it
has never yet been shown experimentally that <i>anything</i>
acquired by one generation is transmitted to the next (putting
aside diseases).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Romanes, writing in <i>Nature</i>, March 18, 1890, and
opposing certain details of Professor Weismann&rsquo;s theory, so
far supports it as to say that &ldquo;there is the gravest
possible doubt lying against the supposition that any really
inherited decrease is due to the inherited effects of
disuse.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;gravest possible doubt&rdquo;
should mean that Mr. Romanes regards it as a moral certainty that
disuse has no transmitted effect in reducing an organ, and it
should follow that he holds use to have no transmitted effect in
its development.&nbsp; The sequel, however, makes me uncertain
how far Mr. Romanes intends this, and I would refer the reader to
the article which Mr. Romanes has just published on Weismann in
the <i>Contemporary Review</i> for this current month.</p>
<p>The burden of Mr. Thiselton Dyer&rsquo;s controversy with the
Duke of Argyll (see <i>Nature</i>, January 16, 1890, <i>et
seq.</i>) was that there was no evidence in support of the
transmission of any acquired modification.&nbsp; The orthodoxy of
science, therefore, must be held as giving at any rate a
provisional support to Professor Weismann, but all of them,
including even Professor Weismann himself, shrink from committing
themselves to the opinion that the germ-cells of any organisms
remain in all cases unaffected by the events that occur to the
other cells of the same organism, and until they do this they
have knocked the bottom out of their case.</p>
<p>From among the passages in which Professor Weismann himself
shows a desire to hedge I may take the following from page 170 of
his book:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am also far from asserting that the germ-plasm which,
as I hold, is transmitted as the basis of heredity from one
generation to another, is absolutely unchangeable or totally
uninfluenced by forces residing in the organism within which it
is transformed into germ-cells.&nbsp; I am also compelled to
admit it as conceivable that organisms may exert a modifying
influence upon their germ-cells, and even that such a process is
to a certain extent inevitable.&nbsp; The nutrition and growth of
the individual must exercise some influence upon its germ-cells .
. . &rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Weismann does indeed go on to say that this
influence must be extremely slight, but we do not care how slight
the changes produced may be provided they exist and can be
transmitted.&nbsp; On an earlier page (p. 101) he said in regard
to variations generally that we should not expect to find them
conspicuous; their frequency would be enough, if they could be
accumulated.&nbsp; The same applies here, if stirring events that
occur to the somatic cells can produce any effect at all on
offspring.&nbsp; A very small effect, provided it can be repeated
and accumulated in successive generations, is all that even the
most exacting Lamarckian will ask for.</p>
<p>Having now made the reader acquainted with the position taken
by the leading Charles-Darwinian authorities, I will return to
Professor Weismann himself, who declares that the transmission of
acquired characters &ldquo;at first sight certainly seems
necessary,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;it appears rash to attempt to
dispense with its aid.&rdquo;&nbsp; He continues:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many phenomena only appear to be intelligible if we
assume the hereditary transmission of such acquired characters as
the changes which we ascribe to the use or disuse of particular
organs, or to the direct influence of climate.&nbsp; Furthermore,
how can we explain instinct as hereditary habit, unless it has
gradually arisen by the accumulation, through heredity, of habits
which were practised in succeeding generations?&rdquo; <a
name="citation33"></a><a href="#footnote33"
class="citation">[33]</a></p>
<p>I may say in passing that Professor Weismann appears to
suppose that the view of instinct just given is part of the
Charles-Darwinian system, for on page 889 of his book he says
&ldquo;that many observers had followed Darwin in explaining them
[instincts] as inherited habits.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was not Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s own view of the matter.&nbsp; He wrote:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we suppose any habitual action to become
inherited&mdash;and I think it can be shown that this does
sometimes happen&mdash;then the resemblance between what
originally was a habit and an instinct becomes so close as not to
be distinguished. . . But it would be the most serious error to
suppose that the greater number of instincts have been acquired
by habit in one generation, and then transmitted by inheritance
to succeeding generations.&nbsp; It can be clearly shown that the
most wonderful instincts with which we are acquainted, namely,
those of the hive-bee and of many ants, could not possibly have
been thus acquired.&rdquo;&mdash;[&ldquo;Origin of
Species,&rdquo; ed., 1859, p. 209.]</p>
<p>Again we read: &ldquo;Domestic instincts are sometimes spoken
of as actions which have become inherited solely from
long-continued and compulsory habit, but this, I think, is not
true.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 214.</p>
<p>Again: &ldquo;I am surprised that no one has advanced this
demonstrative case of neuter insects, against the well-known
doctrine of inherited habit, as advanced by
Lamarck.&rdquo;&mdash;[&ldquo;Origin of Species,&rdquo; ed. 1872,
p. 283.]</p>
<p>I am not aware that Lamarck advanced the doctrine that
instinct is inherited habit, but he may have done so in some work
that I have not seen.</p>
<p>It is true, as I have more than once pointed out, that in the
later editions of the &ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; it is no
longer &ldquo;the <i>most</i> serious&rdquo; error to refer
instincts generally to inherited habit, but it still remains
&ldquo;a serious error,&rdquo; and this slight relaxation of
severity does not warrant Professor Weismann in ascribing to Mr.
Darwin an opinion which he emphatically condemned.&nbsp; His
tone, however, is so offhand, that those who have little
acquaintance with the literature of evolution would hardly guess
that he is not much better informed on this subject than
themselves.</p>
<p>Returning to the inheritance of acquired characters, Professor
Weismann says that this has never been proved either by means of
direct observation or by experiment.&nbsp; &ldquo;It must be
admitted,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;that there are in existence
numerous descriptions of cases which tend to prove that such
mutilations as the loss of fingers, the scars of wounds, &amp;c.,
are inherited by the offspring, but in these descriptions the
previous history is invariably obscure, and hence the evidence
loses all scientific value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The experiments of M.&nbsp; Brown-S&eacute;quard throw so much
light upon the question at issue that I will quote at some length
from the summary given by Mr. Darwin in his &ldquo;Variation of
Animals and Plants under Domestication.&rdquo; <a
name="citation34"></a><a href="#footnote34"
class="citation">[34]</a>&nbsp; Mr. Darwin writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With respect to the inheritance of structures mutilated
by injuries or altered by disease, it was until lately difficult
to come to any definite conclusion.&rdquo;&nbsp; [Then follow
several cases in which mutilations practised for many generations
are not found to be transmitted.]&nbsp;
&ldquo;Notwithstanding,&rdquo; continues Mr. Darwin, &ldquo;the
above several negative cases, we now possess conclusive evidence
that the effects of operations are sometimes inherited.&nbsp; Dr.
Brown-S&eacute;quard gives the following summary of his
observations on guinea-pigs, and this summary is so important
that I will quote the whole:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;1st.&nbsp; Appearance of epilepsy in animals
born of parents having been rendered epileptic by an injury to
the spinal cord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;2nd.&nbsp; Appearance of epilepsy also in
animals born of parents having been rendered epileptic by the
section of the sciatic nerve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;3rd.&nbsp; A change in the shape of the ear in
animals born of parents in which such a change was the effect of
a division of the cervical sympathetic nerve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;4th.&nbsp; Partial closure of the eyelids in
animals born of parents in which that state of the eyelids had
been caused either by the section of the cervical sympathetic
nerve or the removal of the superior cervical ganglion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;5th.&nbsp; Exophthalmia in animals born of
parents in which an injury to the restiform body had produced
that protrusion of the eyeball.&nbsp; This interesting fact I
have witnessed a good many times, and I have seen the
transmission of the morbid state of the eye continue through four
generations.&nbsp; In these animals modified by heredity, the two
eyes generally protruded, although in the parents usually only
one showed exophthalmia, the lesion having been made in most
cases only on one of the corpora restiformia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;6th.&nbsp; H&aelig;matoma and dry gangrene of
the ears in animals born of parents in which these
ear-alterations had been caused by an injury to the restiform
body near the nib of the calamus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;7th.&nbsp; Absence of two toes out of the three
of the hind leg, and sometimes of the three, in animals whose
parents had eaten up their hind-leg toes which had become
an&aelig;sthetic from a section of the sciatic nerve alone, or of
that nerve and also of the crural.&nbsp; Sometimes, instead of
complete absence of the toes, only a part of one or two or three
was missing in the young, although in the parent not only the
toes but the whole foot was absent (partly eaten off, partly
destroyed by inflammation, ulceration, or gangrene).</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;8th.&nbsp; Appearance of various morbid states
of the skin and hair of the neck and face in animals born of
parents having had similar alterations in the same parts, as
effects of an injury to the sciatic nerve.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should be especially observed that
Brown-S&eacute;quard has bred during thirty years many thousand
guinea-pigs from animals which had not been operated upon, and
not one of these manifested the epileptic tendency.&nbsp; Nor has
he ever seen a guinea-pig born without toes, which was not the
offspring of parents which had gnawed off their own toes owing to
the sciatic nerve having been divided.&nbsp; Of this latter fact
thirteen instances were carefully recorded, and a greater number
were seen; yet Brown-S&eacute;quard speaks of such cases as one
of the rarer forms of inheritance.&nbsp; It is a still more
interesting fact, &lsquo;that the sciatic nerve in the
congenitally toeless animal has inherited the power of passing
through all the different morbid states which have occurred in
one of its parents from the time of the division till after its
reunion with the peripheric end.&nbsp; It is not, therefore,
simply the power of performing an action which is inherited, but
the power of performing a whole series of actions, in a certain
order.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In most of the cases of inheritance recorded by
Brown-S&eacute;quard only one of the two parents had been
operated upon and was affected.&nbsp; He concludes by expressing
his belief that &lsquo;what is transmitted is the morbid state of
the nervous system,&rsquo; due to the operation performed on the
parents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Darwin proceeds to give other instances of inherited
effects of mutilations:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the horse there seems hardly a doubt that
exostoses on the legs, caused by too much travelling on hard
roads, are inherited.&nbsp; Blumenbach records the case of a man
who had his little finger on the right hand almost cut off, and
which in consequence grew crooked, and his sons had the same
finger on the same hand similarly crooked.&nbsp; A soldier,
fifteen years before his marriage, lost his left eye from
purulent ophthalmia, and his two sons were microphthalmic on the
same side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The late Professor Rolleston, whose competence as an observer
no one is likely to dispute, gave Mr. Darwin two cases as having
fallen under his own notice, one of a man whose knee had been
severely wounded, and whose child was born with the same spot
marked or scarred, and the other of one who was severely cut upon
the cheek, and whose child was born scarred in the same
place.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s conclusion was that &ldquo;the
effects of injuries, especially when followed by disease, or
perhaps exclusively when thus followed, are occasionally
inherited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us now see what Professor Weismann has to say against
this.&nbsp; He writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only cases worthy of discussion are the well-known
experiments upon guinea-pigs conducted by the French
physiologist, Brown-S&eacute;quard.&nbsp; But the explanation of
his results is, in my opinion, open to discussion.&nbsp; In these
cases we have to do with the apparent transmission of
artificially produced malformations . . . All these effects were
said to be transmitted to descendants as far as the fifth or
sixth generation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we must inquire whether these cases are really due
to heredity, and not to simple infection.&nbsp; In the case of
epilepsy, at any rate, it is easy to imagine that the passage of
some specific organism through the reproductive cells may take
place, as in the case of syphilis.&nbsp; We are, however,
entirely ignorant of the nature of the former disease.&nbsp; This
suggested explanation may not perhaps apply to the other cases;
but we must remember that animals which have been subjected to
such severe operations upon the nervous system have sustained a
great shock, and if they are capable of breeding, it is only
probable that they will produce weak descendants, and such as are
easily affected by disease.&nbsp; Such a result does not,
however, explain why the offspring should suffer from the same
disease as that which was artificially induced in the
parents.&nbsp; But this does not appear to have been by any means
invariably the case.&nbsp; Brown-S&eacute;quard himself says:
&lsquo;The changes in the eye of the offspring were of a very
variable nature, and were only occasionally exactly similar to
those observed in the parents.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no doubt, however, that these experiments
demand careful consideration, but before they can claim
scientific recognition, they must be subjected to rigid criticism
as to the precautions taken, the nature and number of the control
experiments, &amp;c.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up to the present time such necessary conditions have
not been sufficiently observed.&nbsp; The recent experiments
themselves are only described in short preliminary notices,
which, as regards their accuracy, the possibility of mistake, the
precautions taken, and the exact succession of individuals
affected, afford no data on which a scientific opinion can be
founded&rdquo; (pp. 81, 82).</p>
<p>The line Professor Weismann takes, therefore, is to discredit
the facts; yet on a later page we find that the experiments have
since been repeated by Obersteiner, &ldquo;who has described them
in a very exact and unprejudiced manner,&rdquo; and that
&ldquo;the fact&rdquo;&mdash;(I imagine that Professor Weismann
intends &ldquo;the facts&rdquo;)&mdash;&ldquo;cannot be
doubted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On a still later page, however, we read:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If, for instance, it could be shown that artificial
mutilation spontaneously reappears in the offspring with
sufficient frequency to exclude all possibilities of chance, then
such proof [<i>i.e.</i>, that acquired characters can be
transmitted] would be forthcoming.&nbsp; The transmission of
mutilations has been frequently asserted, and has been even
recently again brought forward, but all the supposed instances
have broken down when carefully examined&rdquo; (p. 390).</p>
<p>Here, then, we are told that proof of the occasional
transmission of mutilations would be sufficient to establish the
fact, but on p. 267 we find that no single fact is known which
really proves that acquired characters can be transmitted,
&ldquo;<i>for the ascertained facts which seem to point to the
transmission of artificially produced diseases cannot be
considered as proof</i>&rdquo; [Italics mine.]&nbsp; Perhaps; but
it was mutilation in many cases that Professor Weismann
practically admitted to have been transmitted when he declared
that Obersteiner had verified Brown-S&eacute;quard&rsquo;s
experiments.</p>
<p>That Professor Weismann recognises the vital importance to his
own theory of the question whether or no mutilations can be
transmitted under any circumstances, is evident from a passage on
p. 425 of his work, on which he says: &ldquo;It can hardly be
doubted that mutilations are acquired characters; they do not
arise from any tendency contained in the germ, but are merely the
reaction of the body under certain external influences.&nbsp;
They are, as I have recently expressed it, purely somatogenic
characters&mdash;viz., characters which emanate from the body
(<i>soma</i>) only, as opposed to the germ-cells; they are,
therefore, characters that do not arise from the germ itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If mutilations must necessarily be transmitted&rdquo;
[which no one that I know of has maintained], &ldquo;or even if
they might occasionally be transmitted&rdquo; [which cannot, I
imagine, be reasonably questioned], &ldquo;a powerful support
would be given to the Lamarckian principle, and the transmission
of functional hypertrophy or atrophy would thus become highly
probable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have not found any further attempt in Professor
Weismann&rsquo;s book to deal with the evidence adduced by Mr.
Darwin to show that mutilations, if followed by diseases, are
sometimes inherited; and I must leave it to the reader to
determine how far Professor Weismann has shown reason for
rejecting Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s conclusion.&nbsp; I do not, however,
dwell upon these facts now as evidence of a transmitted change of
bodily form, or of instinct due to use and disuse or habit; what
they prove is that the germ-cells within the parent&rsquo;s body
do not stand apart from the other cells of the body so completely
as Professor Weismann would have us believe, but that, as
Professor Hering, of Prague, has aptly said, they echo with more
or less frequency and force to the profounder impressions made
upon other cells.</p>
<p>I may say that Professor Weismann does not more cavalierly
wave aside the mass of evidence collected by Mr. Darwin and a
host of other writers, to the effect that mutilations are
sometimes inherited, than does Mr. Wallace, who says that,
&ldquo;as regards mutilations, it is generally admitted that they
are not inherited, and there is ample evidence on this
point.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is indeed generally admitted that
mutilations, when not followed by disease, are very rarely, if
ever, inherited; and Mr. Wallace&rsquo;s appeal to the
&ldquo;ample evidence&rdquo; which he alleges to exist on this
head, is much as though he should say that there is ample
evidence to show that the days are longer in summer than in
winter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;a
few cases of apparent inheritance of mutilations have been
recorded, and these, if trustworthy, are difficulties in the way
of the theory.&rdquo; . . . &ldquo;The often-quoted case of a
disease induced by mutilation being inherited
(Brown-S&eacute;quard&rsquo;s epileptic guinea-pigs) has been
discussed by Professor Weismann and shown to be not
conclusive.&nbsp; The mutilation itself&mdash;a section of
certain nerves&mdash;was never inherited, but the resulting
epilepsy, or a general state of weakness, deformity, or sores,
was sometimes inherited.&nbsp; It is, however, possible that the
mere injury introduced and encouraged the growth of certain
microbes, which, spreading through the organism, sometimes
reached the germ-cells, and thus transmitted a diseased condition
to the offspring.&rdquo; <a name="citation35"></a><a
href="#footnote35" class="citation">[35]</a></p>
<p>I suppose a microbe which made guinea-pigs eat their toes off
was communicated to the germ-cells of an unfortunate guinea-pig
which had been already microbed by it, and made the offspring
bite its toes off too.&nbsp; The microbe has a good deal to
answer for.</p>
<p>On the case of the deterioration of horses in the Falkland
Islands after a few generations, Professor Weismann
says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In such a case we have only to assume that the climate
which is unfavourable, and the nutriment which is insufficient
for horses, affect not only the animal as a whole but also its
germ-cells.&nbsp; This would result in the diminution in size of
the germ-cells, the effects upon the offspring being still
further intensified by the insufficient nourishment supplied
during growth.&nbsp; But such results would not depend upon the
transmission by the germ-cells of certain peculiarities due to
the unfavourable climate, which only appear in the full-grown
horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Professor Weismann does not like such cases, and admits
that he cannot explain the facts in connection with the climatic
varieties of certain butterflies, except &ldquo;by supposing the
passive acquisition of characters produced by the direct
influence of climate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless in his next paragraph but one he calls such cases
&ldquo;doubtful,&rdquo; and proposes that for the moment they
should be left aside.&nbsp; He accordingly leaves them, but I
have not yet found what other moment he considered auspicious for
returning to them.&nbsp; He tells us that &ldquo;new experiments
will be necessary, and that he has himself already begun to
undertake them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Perhaps he will give us the results
of these experiments in some future book&mdash;for that they will
prove satisfactory to him can hardly, I think, be doubted.&nbsp;
He writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leaving on one side, for the moment, these doubtful and
insufficiently investigated cases, we may still maintain that the
assumption that changes induced by external conditions in the
organism as a whole are communicated to the germ-cells after the
manner indicated in Darwin&rsquo;s hypothesis of pangenesis, is
wholly unnecessary for the explanation of these phenomena.&nbsp;
Still we cannot exclude the possibility of such a transmission
occasionally occurring, for even if the greater part of the
effects must be attributable to natural selection, there might be
a smaller part in certain cases which depends on this exceptional
factor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I repeatedly tried to understand Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s theory of
pangenesis, and so often failed that I long since gave the matter
up in despair.&nbsp; I did so with the less unwillingness because
I saw that no one else appeared to understand the theory, and
that even Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s warmest adherents regarded it with
disfavour.&nbsp; If Mr. Darwin means that every cell of the body
throws off minute particles that find their way to the
germ-cells, and hence into the new embryo, this is indeed
difficult of comprehension and belief.&nbsp; If he means that the
rhythms or vibrations that go on ceaselessly in every cell of the
body communicate themselves with greater or less accuracy or
perturbation, as the case may be, to the cells that go to form
offspring, and that since the characteristics of matter are
determined by vibrations, in communicating vibrations they in
effect communicate matter, according to the view put forward in
the last chapter of my book &ldquo;Luck or Cunning,&rdquo; <a
name="citation36"></a><a href="#footnote36"
class="citation">[36]</a> then we can better understand it.&nbsp;
I have nothing, however, to do with Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s theory of
pangenesis beyond avoiding the pretence that I understand either
the theory itself or what Professor Weismann says about it; all I
am concerned with is Professor Weismann&rsquo;s admission, made
immediately afterwards, that the somatic cells may, and perhaps
sometimes do, impart characteristics to the germ-cells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A complete and satisfactory refutation of such an
opinion,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;cannot be brought forward at
present&rdquo;; so I suppose we must wait a little longer, but in
the meantime we may again remark that, if we admit even
occasional communication of changes in the somatic cells to the
germ-cells, we have let in the thin end of the wedge, as Mr.
Darwin did when he said that use and disuse did a good deal
towards modification.&nbsp; Buffon, in his first volume on the
lower animals, <a name="citation37"></a><a href="#footnote37"
class="citation">[37]</a> dwells on the impossibility of stopping
the breach once made by admission of variation at all.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If the point,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;were once gained,
that among animals and vegetables there had been, I do not say
several species, but even a single one, which had been produced
in the course of direct descent from another species; if, for
example, it could be once shown that the ass was but a
degeneration from the horse&mdash;then there is no farther limit
to be set to the power of Nature, and we should not be wrong in
supposing that with sufficient time she could have evolved all
other organised forms from one primordial type.&rdquo;&nbsp; So
with use and disuse and transmission of acquired characteristics
generally&mdash;once show that a single structure or instinct is
due to habit in preceding generations, and we can impose no limit
on the results achievable by accumulation in this respect, nor
shall we be wrong in conceiving it as possible that all
specialisation, whether of structure or instinct, may be due
ultimately to habit.</p>
<p>How far this can be shown to be probable is, of course,
another matter, but I am not immediately concerned with this; all
I am concerned with now is to show that the germ-cells not
unfrequently become permanently affected by events that have made
a profound impression upon the somatic cells, in so far that they
transmit an obvious reminiscence of the impression to the embryos
which they go subsequently towards forming.&nbsp; This is all
that is necessary for my case, and I do not find that Professor
Weismann, after all, disputes it.</p>
<p>But here, again, comes the difficulty of saying what Professor
Weismann does, and what he does not, dispute.&nbsp; One moment he
gives all that is wanted for the Lamarckian contention, the next
he denies common-sense the bare necessaries of life.&nbsp; For a
more exhaustive and detailed criticism of Professor
Weismann&rsquo;s position, I would refer the reader to an
admirably clear article by Mr. Sidney H. Vines, which appeared in
<i>Nature</i>, October 24, 1889.&nbsp; I can only say that while
reading Professor Weismann&rsquo;s book, I feel as I do when I
read those of Mr. Darwin, and of a good many other writers on
biology whom I need not name.&nbsp; I become like a fly in a
window-pane.&nbsp; I see the sunshine and freedom beyond, and
buzz up and down their pages, ever hopeful to get through them to
the fresh air without, but ever kept back by a mysterious
something, which I feel but cannot either grasp or see.&nbsp; It
was not thus when I read Buffon, Erasmus Darwin, and Lamarck; it
is not thus when I read such articles as Mr. Vines&rsquo;s just
referred to.&nbsp; Love of self-display, and the want of
singleness of mind that it inevitably engenders&mdash;these, I
suppose, are the sins that glaze the casements of most
men&rsquo;s minds; and from these, no matter how hard he tries to
free himself, nor how much he despises them, who is altogether
exempt?</p>
<p>Finally, then, when we consider the immense mass of evidence
referred to briefly, but sufficiently, by Mr. Charles Darwin, and
referred to without other, for the most part, than off-hand
dismissal by Professor Weismann in the last of the essays that
have been recently translated, I do not see how any one who
brings an unbiased mind to the question can hesitate as to the
side on which the weight of testimony inclines.&nbsp; Professor
Weismann declares that &ldquo;the transmission of mutilations may
be dismissed into the domain of fable.&rdquo; <a
name="citation38"></a><a href="#footnote38"
class="citation">[38]</a>&nbsp; If so, then, whom can we
trust?&nbsp; What is the use of science at all if the conclusions
of a man as competent as I readily admit Mr. Darwin to have been,
on the evidence laid before him from countless sources, is to be
set aside lightly and without giving the clearest and most cogent
explanation of the why and wherefore?&nbsp; When we see a person
&ldquo;ostrichising&rdquo; the evidence which he has to meet, as
clearly as I believe Professor Weismann to be doing, we shall in
nine cases out of ten be right in supposing that he knows the
evidence to be too strong for him.</p>
<h3>THE DEADLOCK IN DARWINISM&mdash;PART III</h3>
<p>Now let me return to the recent division of biological opinion
into two main streams&mdash;Lamarckism and Weismannism Both
Lamarckians and Weismannists, not to mention mankind in general,
admit that the better adapted to its surroundings a living form
may be, the more likely it is to outbreed its compeers.&nbsp; The
world at large, again, needs not to be told that the normal
course is not unfrequently deflected through the fortunes of war;
nevertheless, according to Lamarckians and Erasmus-Darwinians,
habitual effort, guided by ever-growing intelligence&mdash;that
is to say, by continued increase of power in the matter of
knowing our likes and dislikes&mdash;has been so much the main
factor throughout the course of organic development, that the
rest, though not lost sight of, may be allowed to go without
saying.&nbsp; According, on the other hand, to extreme
Charles-Darwinians and Weismannists, habit, effort and
intelligence acquired during the experience of any one life goes
for nothing.&nbsp; Not even a little fraction of it endures to
the benefit of offspring.&nbsp; It dies with him in whom it is
acquired, and the heirs of a man&rsquo;s body take no interest
therein.&nbsp; To state this doctrine is to arouse instinctive
loathing; it is my fortunate task to maintain that such a
nightmare of waste and death is as baseless as it is
repulsive.</p>
<p>The split in biological opinion occasioned by the deadlock to
which Charles-Darwinism has been reduced, though comparatively
recent, widens rapidly.&nbsp; Ten years ago Lamarck&rsquo;s name
was mentioned only as a byword for extravagance; now, we cannot
take up a number of <i>Nature</i> without seeing how hot the
contention is between his followers and those of Weismann.&nbsp;
This must be referred, as I implied earlier, to growing
perception that Mr. Darwin should either have gone farther
towards Lamarckism or not so far.&nbsp; In admitting use and
disuse as freely as he did, he gave Lamarckians leverage for the
overthrow of a system based ostensibly on the accumulation of
fortunate accidents.&nbsp; In assigning the lion&rsquo;s share of
development to the accumulation of fortunate accidents, he
tempted fortuitists to try to cut the ground from under
Lamarck&rsquo;s feet by denying that the effects of use and
disuse can be inherited at all.&nbsp; When the public had once
got to understand what Lamarck had intended, and wherein Mr.
Charles Darwin had differed from him, it became impossible for
Charles-Darwinians to remain where they were, nor is it easy to
see what course was open to them except to cast about for a
theory by which they could get rid of use and disuse
altogether.&nbsp; Weismannism, therefore, is the inevitable
outcome of the straits to which Charles-Darwinians were reduced
through the way in which their leader had halted between two
opinions.</p>
<p>This is why Charles-Darwinians, from Professor Huxley
downwards, have kept the difference between Lamarck&rsquo;s
opinions and those of Mr. Darwin so much in the background.&nbsp;
Unwillingness to make this understood is nowhere manifested more
clearly than in Dr. Francis Darwin&rsquo;s life of his
father.&nbsp; In this work Lamarck is sneered at once or twice,
and told to go away, but there is no attempt to state the two
cases side by side; from which, as from not a little else, I
conclude that Dr. Francis Darwin has descended from his father
with singularly little modification.</p>
<p>Proceeding to the evidence for the transmissions of acquired
habits, I will quote two recently adduced examples from among the
many that have been credibly attested.&nbsp; The first was
contributed to <i>Nature</i> (March 14, 1889) by Professor Marcus
M. Hartog, who wrote:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A. B. is moderately myopic and very astigmatic in the
left eye; extremely myopic in the right.&nbsp; As the left eye
gave such bad images for near objects, he was compelled in
childhood to mask it, and acquired the habit of leaning his head
on his left arm for writing, so as to blind that eye, or of
resting the left temple and eye on the hand, with the elbow on
the table.&nbsp; At the age of fifteen the eyes were equalised by
the use of suitable spectacles, and he soon lost the habit
completely and permanently.&nbsp; He is now the father of two
children, a boy and a girl, whose vision (tested repeatedly and
fully) is emmetropic in both eyes, so that they have not
inherited the congenital optical defect of their father.&nbsp;
All the same, they have both of them inherited his early acquired
habit, and need constant watchfulness to prevent their hiding the
left eye when writing, by resting the head on the left forearm or
hand.&nbsp; Imitation is here quite out of the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Considering that every habit involves changes in the
proportional development of the muscular and osseous systems, and
hence probably of the nervous system also, the importance of
inherited habits, natural or acquired, cannot be overlooked in
the general theory of inheritance.&nbsp; I am fully aware that I
shall be accused of flat Lamarckism, but a nickname is not an
argument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this Professor Ray Lankester rejoined (<i>Nature</i>, March
21, 1889):&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not unusual for children to rest the head on the
left forearm or hand when writing, and I doubt whether much value
can be attached to the case described by Professor Hartog.&nbsp;
The kind of observation which his letter suggests is, however,
likely to lead to results either for or against the transmission
of acquired characters.&nbsp; An old friend of mine lost his
right arm when a schoolboy, and has ever since written with his
left.&nbsp; He has a large family and grandchildren, but I have
not heard of any of them showing a disposition to
left-handedness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From <i>Nature</i> (March 21, 1889) I take the second instance
communicated by Mr. J. Jenner-Weir, who wrote as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Marcus M. Hartog&rsquo;s letter of March 6th,
inserted in last week&rsquo;s number (p. 462), is a very valuable
contribution to the growing evidence that acquired characters may
be inherited.&nbsp; I have long held the view that such is often
the case, and I have myself observed several instances of the, at
least I may say, apparent fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many years ago there was a very fine male of the
<i>Capra megaceros</i> in the gardens of the Zoological
Society.&nbsp; To restrain this animal from jumping over the
fence of the enclosure in which he was confined, a long, and
heavy chain was attached to the collar round his neck.&nbsp; He
was constantly in the habit of taking this chain up by his horns
and moving it from one side to another over his back; in doing
this he threw his head very much back, his horns being placed in
a line with the back.&nbsp; The habit had become quite chronic
with him, and was very tiresome to look at.&nbsp; I was very much
astonished to observe that his offspring inherited the habit, and
although it was not necessary to attach a chain to their necks, I
have often seen a young male throwing his horns over his back and
shifting from side to side an imaginary chain.&nbsp; The action
was exactly the same as that of his ancestor.&nbsp; The case of
the kid of this goat appears to me to be parallel to that of
child and parent given by Mr. Hartog.&nbsp; I think at the time I
made this observation I informed Mr. Darwin of the fact by
letter, and he did not accuse me of &lsquo;flat
Lamarckism.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this letter there was no rejoinder.&nbsp; It may be said,
of course, that the action of the offspring in each of these
cases was due to accidental coincidence only.&nbsp; Anything can
be said, but the question turns not on what an advocate can say,
but on what a reasonably intelligent and disinterested jury will
believe; granted they might be mistaken in accepting the
foregoing stories, but the world of science, like that of
commerce, is based on the faith or confidence, which both creates
and sustains them.&nbsp; Indeed the universe itself is but the
creature of faith, for assuredly we know of no other
foundation.&nbsp; There is nothing so generally and reasonably
accepted&mdash;not even our own continued identity&mdash;but
questions may be raised about it that will shortly prove
unanswerable.&nbsp; We cannot so test every sixpence given us in
change as to be sure that we never take a bad one, and had better
sometimes be cheated than reduce caution to an absurdity.&nbsp;
Moreover, we have seen from the evidence given in my preceding
article that the germ-cells issuing from a parent&rsquo;s body
can, and do, respond to profound impressions made on the
somatic-cells.&nbsp; This being so, what impressions are more
profound, what needs engage more assiduous attention than those
connected with self-protection, the procuring of food, and the
continuation of the species?&nbsp; If the mere anxiety connected
with an ill-healing wound inflicted on but one generation is
sometimes found to have so impressed the germ-cells that they
hand down its scars to offspring, how much more shall not
anxieties that have directed action of all kinds from birth till
death, not in one generation only but in a longer series of
generations than the mind can realise to itself, modify, and
indeed control, the organisation of every species?</p>
<p>I see Professor S. H. Vines, in the article on
Weismann&rsquo;s theory referred to in my preceding article, says
Mr. Darwin &ldquo;held that it was not the sudden variations due
to altered external conditions which become permanent, but those
slowly produced by what he termed &lsquo;the accumulative action
of changed conditions of life.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Nothing can be
more soundly Lamarckian, and nothing should more conclusively
show that, whatever else Mr. Darwin was, he was not a
Charles-Darwinian; but what evidence other than inferential can
from the nature of the case be adduced in support of this, as I
believe, perfectly correct judgment?&nbsp; None know better than
they who clamour for direct evidence that their master was right
in taking the position assigned to him by Professor Vines, that
they cannot reasonably look for it.&nbsp; With us, as with
themselves, modification proceeds very gradually, and it violates
our principles as much as their own to expect visible permanent
progress, in any single generation, or indeed in any number of
generations of wild species which we have yet had time to
observe.&nbsp; Occasionally we can find such cases, as in that of
<i>Branchipus stagnalis</i>, quoted by Mr. Wallace, or in that of
the New Zealand Kea whose skin, I was assured by the late Sir
Julius von Haast, has already been modified as a consequence of
its change of food.&nbsp; Here we can show that in even a few
generations structure is modified under changed conditions of
existence, but as we believe these cases to occur comparatively
rarely, so it is still more rarely that they occur when and where
we can watch them.&nbsp; Nature is eminently conservative, and
fixity of type, even under considerable change of conditions, is
surely more important for the well-being of any species than an
over-ready power of adaptation to, it may be, passing
changes.&nbsp; There could be no steady progress if each
generation were not mainly bound by the traditions of those that
have gone before it.&nbsp; It is evolution and not incessant
revolution that both parties are upholding; and this being so,
rapid visible modification must be the exception, not the
rule.&nbsp; I have quoted direct evidence adduced by competent
observers, which is, I believe, sufficient to establish the fact
that offspring can be and is sometimes modified by the acquired
habits of a progenitor.&nbsp; I will now proceed to the still
more, as it appears to me, cogent proof afforded by general
considerations.</p>
<p>What, let me ask, are the principal phenomena of
heredity?&nbsp; There must be physical continuity between parent,
or parents, and offspring, so that the offspring is, as Erasmus
Darwin well said, a kind of elongation of the life of the
parent.</p>
<p>Erasmus Darwin put the matter so well that I may as well give
his words in full; he wrote:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Owing to the imperfection of language the offspring is
termed a new animal, but is in truth a branch or elongation of
the parent, since a part of the embryon animal is, or was, a part
of the parent, and therefore, in strict language, cannot be said
to be entirely new at the time of its production; and therefore
it may retain some of the habits of the parent system.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the earliest period of its existence the embryon
would seem to consist of a living filament with certain
capabilities of irritation, sensation, volition, and association,
and also with some acquired habits or propensities peculiar to
the parent; the former of these are in common with other animals;
the latter seem to distinguish or produce the kind of animal,
whether man or quadruped, with the similarity of feature or form
to the parent.&rdquo; <a name="citation39"></a><a
href="#footnote39" class="citation">[39]</a></p>
<p>Those who accept evolution insist on unbroken physical
continuity between the earliest known life and ourselves, so that
we both are and are not personally identical with the unicellular
organism from which we have descended in the course of many
millions of years, exactly in the same way as an octogenarian
both is and is not personally identical with the microscopic
impregnate ovum from which he grew up.&nbsp; Everything both is
and is not.&nbsp; There is no such thing as strict identity
between any two things in any two consecutive seconds.&nbsp; In
strictness they are identical and yet not identical, so that in
strictness they violate a fundamental rule of
strictness&mdash;namely, that a thing shall never be itself and
not itself at one and the same time; we must choose between logic
and dealing in a practical spirit with time and space; it is not
surprising, therefore, that logic, in spite of the show of
respect outwardly paid to her, is told to stand aside when people
come to practice.&nbsp; In practice identity is generally held to
exist where continuity is only broken slowly and piecemeal,
nevertheless, that occasional periods of even rapid change are
not held to bar identity, appears from the fact that no one
denies this to hold between the microscopically small impregnate
ovum and the born child that springs from it, nor yet, therefore,
between the impregnate ovum and the octogenarian into which the
child grows; for both ovum and octogenarian are held personally
identical with the newborn baby, and things that are identical
with the same are identical with one another.</p>
<p>The first, then, and most important element of heredity is
that there should be unbroken continuity, and hence sameness of
personality, between parents and offspring, in neither more nor
less than the same sense as that in which any other two
personalities are said to be the same.&nbsp; The repetition,
therefore, of its developmental stages by any offspring must be
regarded as something which the embryo repeating them has already
done once, in the person of one or other parent; and if once,
then, as many times as there have been generations between any
given embryo now repeating it, and the point in life from which
we started&mdash;say, for example, the amoeba.&nbsp; In the case
of asexually and sexually produced organisms alike, the offspring
must be held to continue the personality of the parent or
parents, and hence on the occasion of every fresh development, to
be repeating something which in the person of its parent or
parents it has done once, and if once, then any number of times,
already.</p>
<p>It is obvious, therefore, that the germ-plasm (or whatever the
fancy word for it may be) of any one generation is as physically
identical with the germ-plasm of its predecessor as any two
things can be.&nbsp; The difference between Professor Weismann
and, we will say, Heringians consists in the fact that the first
maintains the new germ-plasm when on the point of repeating its
developmental processes to take practically no cognisance of
anything that has happened to it since the last occasion on which
it developed itself; while the latter maintain that offspring
takes much the same kind of account of what has happened to it in
the persons of its parents since the last occasion on which it
developed itself, as people in ordinary life take of things that
happen to them.&nbsp; In daily life people let fairly normal
circumstances come and go without much heed as matters of
course.&nbsp; If they have been lucky they make a note of it and
try to repeat their success.&nbsp; If they have been unfortunate
but have recovered rapidly they soon forget it; if they have
suffered long and deeply they grizzle over it and are scared and
scarred by it for a long time.&nbsp; The question is one of
cognisance or non-cognisance on the part of the new germs, of the
more profound impressions made on them while they were one with
their parents, between the occasion of their last preceding
development, and the new course on which they are about to
enter.&nbsp; Those who accept the theory put forward
independently by Professor Hering of Prague (whose work on this
subject is translated in my book, &ldquo;Unconscious
Memory&rdquo;) <a name="citation40"></a><a href="#footnote40"
class="citation">[40]</a> and by myself in &ldquo;Life and
Habit,&rdquo; <a name="citation41"></a><a href="#footnote41"
class="citation">[41]</a> believe in cognizance, as do
Lamarckians generally.&nbsp; Weismannites, and with them the
orthodoxy of English science, find non-cognisance more
acceptable.</p>
<p>If the Heringian view is accepted, that heredity is only a
mode of memory, and an extension of memory from one generation to
another, then the repetition of its development by any embryo
thus becomes only the repetition of a lesson learned by rote;
and, as I have elsewhere said, our view of life is simplified by
finding that it is no longer an equation of, say, a hundred
unknown quantities, but of ninety-nine only, inasmuch as two of
the unknown quantities prove to be substantially identical.&nbsp;
In this case the inheritance of acquired characteristics cannot
be disputed, for it is postulated in the theory that each embryo
takes note of, remembers and is guided by the profounder
impressions made upon it while in the persons of its parents,
between its present and last preceding development.&nbsp; To
maintain this is to maintain use and disuse to be the main
factors throughout organic development; to deny it is to deny
that use and disuse can have any conceivable effect.&nbsp; For
the detailed reasons which led me to my own conclusions I must
refer the reader to my books, &ldquo;Life and Habit&rdquo; <a
name="citation42"></a><a href="#footnote42"
class="citation">[42]</a> and &ldquo;Unconscious Memory,&rdquo;
the conclusions of which have been
often adopted, but never, that I have seen, disputed.&nbsp; A
brief <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of the leading points in the
argument is all that space will here allow me to give.</p>
<p>We have seen that it is a first requirement of heredity that
there shall be physical continuity between parents and
offspring.&nbsp; This holds good with memory.&nbsp; There must be
continued identity between the person remembering and the person
to whom the thing that is remembered happened.&nbsp; We cannot
remember things that happened to some one else, and in our
absence.&nbsp; We can only remember having heard of them.&nbsp;
We have seen, however, that there is as much
<i>bon&acirc;-fide</i> sameness of personality between parents
and offspring up to the time at which the offspring quits the
parent&rsquo;s body, as there is between the different states of
the parent himself at any two consecutive moments; the offspring
therefore, being one and the same person with its progenitors
until it quits them, can be held to remember what happened to
them within, of course, the limitations to which all memory is
subject, as much as the progenitors can remember what happened
earlier to themselves.&nbsp; Whether it does so remember can only
be settled by observing whether it acts as living beings commonly
do when they are acting under guidance of memory.&nbsp; I will
endeavour to show that, though heredity and habit based on memory
go about in different dresses, yet if we catch them
separately&mdash;for they are never seen together&mdash;and strip
them there is not a mole nor strawberry-mark, nor trick nor leer
of the one, but we find it in the other also.</p>
<p>What are the moles and strawberry-marks of habitual action, or
actions remembered and thus repeated?&nbsp; First, the more often
we repeat them the more easily and unconsciously we do
them.&nbsp; Look at reading, writing, walking, talking, playing
the piano, &amp;c.; the longer we have practised any one of these
acquired habits, the more easily, automatically and
unconsciously, we perform it.&nbsp; Look, on the other hand,
broadly, at the three points to which I called attention in
&ldquo;Life and Habit&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; That we are most conscious of and have most control
over such habits as speech, the upright position, the arts and
sciences&mdash;which are acquisitions peculiar to the human race,
always acquired after birth, and not common to ourselves and any
ancestor who had not become entirely human.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; That we are less conscious of and have less control
over eating and drinking [provided the food be normal],
swallowing, breathing, seeing, and hearing&mdash;which were
acquisitions of our prehuman ancestry, and for which we had
provided ourselves with all the necessary apparatus before we saw
light, but which are still, geologically speaking, recent.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; That we are most unconscious of and have least
control over our digestion and circulation&mdash;powers possessed
even by our invertebrate ancestry, and, geologically speaking, of
extreme antiquity.</p>
<p>I have put the foregoing very broadly, but enough is given to
show the reader the gist of the argument.&nbsp; Let it be noted
that disturbance and departure, to any serious extent, from
normal practice tends to induce resumption of consciousness even
in the case of such old habits as breathing, seeing, and hearing,
digestion and the circulation of the blood.&nbsp; So it is with
habitual actions in general.&nbsp; Let a player be never so
proficient on any instrument, he will be put out if the normal
conditions under which he plays are too widely departed from, and
will then do consciously, if indeed he can do it at all, what he
had hitherto been doing unconsciously.&nbsp; It is an axiom as
regards actions acquired after birth, that we never do them
automatically save as the result of long practice; the stages in
the case of any acquired facility, the inception of which we have
been able to watch, have invariably been from a nothingness of
ignorant impotence to a little somethingness of highly
self-conscious, arduous performance, and thence to the
unselfconsciousness of easy mastery.&nbsp; I saw one year a poor
blind lad of about eighteen sitting on a wall by the wayside at
Varese, playing the concertina with his whole body, and snorting
like a child.&nbsp; The next year the boy no longer snorted, and
he played with his fingers only; the year after that he seemed
hardly to know whether he was playing or not, it came so easily
to him.&nbsp; I know no exception to this rule.&nbsp; Where is
the intricate and at one time difficult art in which perfect
automatic ease has been reached except as the result of long
practice?&nbsp; If, then, wherever we can trace the development
of automatism we find it to have taken this course, is it not
most reasonable to infer that it has taken the same even when it
has risen in regions that are beyond our ken?&nbsp; Ought we not,
whenever we see a difficult action performed, automatically to
suspect antecedent practice?&nbsp; Granted that without the
considerations in regard to identity presented above it would not
have been easy to see where a baby of a day old could have had
the practice which enables it to do as much as it does
unconsciously, but even without these considerations it would
have been more easy to suppose that the necessary opportunities
had not been wanting, than that the easy performance could have
been gained without practice and memory.</p>
<p>When I wrote &ldquo;Life and Habit&rdquo; (originally
published in 1877) I said in slightly different words:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we say that a baby of a day old sucks (which
involves the whole principle of the pump and hence a profound
practical knowledge of the laws of pneumatics and hydrostatics),
digests, oxygenises its blood&mdash;millions of years before any
one had discovered oxygen&mdash;sees and hears, operations that
involve an unconscious knowledge of the facts concerning optics
and acoustics compared with which the conscious discoveries of
Newton are insignificant&mdash;shall we say that a baby can do
all these things at once, doing them so well and so regularly
without being even able to give them attention, and yet without
mistake, and shall we also say at the same time that it has not
learnt to do them, and never did them before?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such an assertion would contradict the whole experience
of mankind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have met with nothing during the thirteen years since the
foregoing was published that has given me any qualms about its
soundness.&nbsp; From the point of view of the law courts and
everyday life it is, of course, nonsense; but in the kingdom of
thought, as in that of heaven, there are many mansions, and what
would be extravagance in the cottage or farmhouse, as it were, of
daily practice, is but common decency in the palace of high
philosophy, wherein dwells evolution.&nbsp; If we leave evolution
alone, we may stick to common practice and the law courts; touch
evolution and we are in another world; not higher, not lower, but
different as harmony from counterpoint.&nbsp; As, however, in the
most absolute counterpoint there is still harmony, and in the
most absolute harmony still counterpoint, so high philosophy
should be still in touch with common sense, and common sense with
high philosophy.</p>
<p>The common-sense view of the matter to people who are not
over-curious and to whom time is money, will be that a baby is
not a baby until it is born, and that when born it should be born
in wedlock.&nbsp; Nevertheless, as a sop to high philosophy,
every baby is allowed to be the offspring of its father and
mother.</p>
<p>The high-philosophy view of the matter is that every human
being is still but a fresh edition of the primordial cell with
the latest additions and corrections; there has been no leap nor
break in continuity anywhere; the man of to-day is the primordial
cell of millions of years ago as truly as he is the himself of
yesterday; he can only be denied to be the one on grounds that
will prove him not to be the other.&nbsp; Every one is both
himself and all his direct ancestors and descendants as well;
therefore, if we would be logical, he is one also with all his
cousins, no matter how distant, for he and they are alike
identical with the primordial cell, and we have already noted it
as an axiom that things which are identical with the same are
identical with one another.&nbsp; This is practically making him
one with all living things, whether animal or vegetable, that
ever have existed or ever will&mdash;something of all which may
have been in the mind of Sophocles when he wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nor seest thou yet the gathering hosts of
ill<br />
That shall en-one thee both with thine own self<br />
And with thine offspring.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And all this has come of admitting that a man may be the same
person for two days running!&nbsp; As for sopping common sense it
will be enough to say that these remarks are to be taken in a
strictly scientific sense, and have no appreciable importance as
regards life and conduct.&nbsp; True they deal with the
foundations on which all life and conduct are based, but like
other foundations they are hidden out of sight, and the sounder
they are, the less we trouble ourselves about them.</p>
<p>What other main common features between heredity and memory
may we note besides the fact that neither can exist without that
kind of physical continuity which we call personal
identity?&nbsp; First, the development of the embryo proceeds in
an established order; so must all habitual actions based on
memory.&nbsp; Disturb the normal order and the performance is
arrested.&nbsp; The better we know &ldquo;God save the
Queen,&rdquo; the less easily can we play or sing it
backwards.&nbsp; The return of memory again depends on the return
of ideas associated with the particular thing that is
remembered&mdash;we remember nothing but for the presence of
these, and when enough of these are presented to us we remember
everything.&nbsp; So, if the development of an embryo is due to
memory, we should suppose the memory of the impregnate ovum to
revert not to yesterday, when it was in the persons of its
parents, but to the last occasion on which it was an impregnate
ovum.&nbsp; The return of the old environment and the presence of
old associations would at once involve recollection of the course
that should be next taken, and the same should happen throughout
the whole course of development.&nbsp; The actual course of
development presents precisely the phenomena agreeable with
this.&nbsp; For fuller treatment of this point I must refer the
reader to the chapter on the abeyance of memory in my book
&ldquo;Life and Habit,&rdquo; already referred to.</p>
<p>Secondly, we remember best our last few performances of any
given kind, so our present performance will probably resemble
some one or other of these; we remember our earlier performances
by way of residuum only, but every now and then we revert to an
earlier habit.&nbsp; This feature of memory is manifested in
heredity by the way in which offspring commonly resembles most
its nearer ancestors, but sometimes reverts to earlier
ones.&nbsp; Brothers and sisters, each as it were giving their
own version of the same story, but in different words, should
generally resemble each other more closely than more distant
relations.&nbsp; And this is what actually we find.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the introduction of slightly new elements into a
method already established varies it beneficially; the new is
soon fused with the old, and the monotony ceases to be
oppressive.&nbsp; But if the new be too foreign, we cannot fuse
the old and the new&mdash;nature seeming to hate equally too wide
a deviation from ordinary practice and none at all.&nbsp; This
fact reappears in heredity as the beneficial effects of
occasional crossing on the one hand, and on the other, in the
generally observed sterility of hybrids.&nbsp; If heredity be an
affair of memory, how can an embryo, say of a mule, be expected
to build up a mule on the strength of but two
mule-memories?&nbsp; Hybridism causes a fault in the chain of
memory, and it is to this cause that the usual sterility of
hybrids must be referred.</p>
<p>Fourthly, it requires many repeated impressions to fix a
method firmly, but when it has been engrained into us we cease to
have much recollection of the manner in which it came to be so,
or indeed of any individual repetition, but sometimes a single
impression, if prolonged as well as profound, produces a lasting
impression and is liable to return with sudden force, and then to
go on returning to us at intervals.&nbsp; As a general rule,
however, abnormal impressions cannot long hold their own against
the overwhelming preponderance of normal authority.&nbsp; This
appears in heredity as the normal non-inheritance of mutilations
on the one hand, and on the other as their occasional inheritance
in the case of injuries followed by disease.</p>
<p>Fifthly, if heredity and memory are essentially the same, we
should expect that no animal would develop new structures of
importance after the age at which its species begins ordinarily
to continue its race; for we cannot suppose offspring to remember
anything that happens to the parent subsequently to the
parent&rsquo;s ceasing to contain the offspring within
itself.&nbsp; From the average age, therefore, of reproduction,
offspring should cease to have any farther steady, continuous
memory to fall back upon; what memory there is should be full of
faults, and as such unreliable.&nbsp; An organism ought to
develop as long as it is backed by memory&mdash;that is to say,
until the average age at which reproduction begins; it should
then continue to go for a time on the impetus already received,
and should eventually decay through failure of any memory to
support it, and tell it what to do.&nbsp; This corresponds
absolutely with what we observe in organisms generally, and
explains, on the one hand, why the age of puberty marks the
beginning of completed development&mdash;a riddle hitherto not
only unexplained but, so far as I have seen, unasked; it
explains, on the other hand, the phenomena of old
age&mdash;hitherto without even attempt at explanation.</p>
<p>Sixthly, those organisms that are the longest in reaching
maturity should on the average be the longest-lived, for they
will have received the most momentous impulse from the weight of
memory behind them.&nbsp; This harmonises with the latest opinion
as to the facts.&nbsp; In his article on Weismann in the
<i>Contemporary Review</i> for May 1890, Mr. Romanes writes:
&ldquo;Professor Weismann has shown that there is throughout the
metazoa a general correlation between the natural lifetime of
individuals composing any given species, and the age at which
they reach maturity or first become capable of
procreation.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, I believe, has been the
conclusion generally arrived at by biologists for some years
past.</p>
<p>Lateness, then, in the average age of reproduction appears to
be the principle underlying longevity.&nbsp; There does not
appear at first sight to be much connection between such distinct
and apparently disconnected phenomena as 1, the orderly normal
progress of development; 2, atavism and the resumption of feral
characteristics; 3, the more ordinary resemblance <i>inter se</i>
of nearer relatives; 4, the benefit of an occasional cross, and
the usual sterility of hybrids; 5, the unconsciousness with which
alike bodily development and ordinary physiological functions
proceed, so long as they are normal; 6, the ordinary
non-inheritance, but occasional inheritance of mutilations; 7,
the fact that puberty indicates the approach of maturity; 8, the
phenomena of middle life and old age; 9, the principle underlying
longevity.&nbsp; These phenomena have no conceivable bearing on
one another until heredity and memory are regarded as part of the
same story.&nbsp; Identify these two things, and I know no
phenomenon of heredity that does not immediately become
infinitely more intelligible.&nbsp; Is it conceivable that a
theory which harmonises so many facts hitherto regarded as
without either connection or explanation should not deserve at
any rate consideration from those who profess to take an interest
in biology?</p>
<p>It is not as though the theory were unknown, or had been
condemned by our leading men of science.&nbsp; Professor Ray
Lankester introduced it to English readers in an appreciative
notice of Professor Hering&rsquo;s address, which appeared in
<i>Nature</i>, July 18, 1876.&nbsp; He wrote to the
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, March 24, 1884, and claimed credit for
having done so, but I do not believe he has ever said more in
public about it than what I have here referred to.&nbsp; Mr.
Romanes did indeed try to crush it in <i>Nature</i>, January 27,
1881, but in 1883, in his &ldquo;Mental Evolution in
Animals,&rdquo; he adopted its main conclusion without
acknowledgment.&nbsp; The <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, to my unbounded
surprise, called him to task for this (March 1, 1884), and since
that time he has given the Heringian theory a sufficiently wide
berth.&nbsp; Mr. Wallace showed himself favourably enough
disposed towards the view that heredity and memory are part of
the same story when he reviewed my book &ldquo;Life and
Habit&rdquo; in <i>Nature</i>, March 27, 1879, but he has never
since betrayed any sign of being aware that such a theory
existed.&nbsp; Mr. Herbert Spencer wrote to the
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i> (April 5, 1884), and claimed the theory for
himself, but, in spite of his doing this, he has never, that I
have seen, referred to the matter again.&nbsp; I have dealt
sufficiently with his claim in my book, &ldquo;Luck or
Cunning.&rdquo; <a name="citation43"></a><a href="#footnote43"
class="citation">[43]</a>&nbsp; Lastly, Professor Hering himself
has never that I know of touched his own theory since the single
short address read in 1870, and translated by me in 1881.&nbsp;
Every one, even its originator, except myself, seems afraid to
open his mouth about it.&nbsp; Of course the inference suggests
itself that other people have more sense than I have.&nbsp; I
readily admit it; but why have so many of our leaders shown such
a strong hankering after the theory, if there is nothing in
it?</p>
<p>The deadlock that I have pointed out as existing in Darwinism
will, I doubt not, lead ere long to a consideration of Professor
Hering&rsquo;s theory.&nbsp; English biologists are little likely
to find Weismann satisfactory for long, and if he breaks down
there is nothing left for them but Lamarck, supplemented by the
important and elucidatory corollary on his theory proposed by
Professor Hering.&nbsp; When the time arrives for this to obtain
a hearing it will be confirmed, doubtless, by arguments clearer
and more forcible than any I have been able to adduce; I shall
then be delighted to resign the championship which till then I
shall continue, as for some years past, to have much pleasure in
sustaining.&nbsp; Heretofore my satisfaction has mainly lain in
the fact that more of our prominent men of science have seemed
anxious to claim the theory than to refute it; in the confidence
thus engendered I leave it to any fuller consideration which the
outline I have above given may incline the reader to bestow upon
it.</p>

Anton Ruppen, ein geschickter Steinhauer mid Maurermeister

class="footnote">[14]</a>&nbsp; The story of Tabachetti&rsquo;s
incarceration is very doubtful.&nbsp; Cavaliere F. Negri, to
whose book on Tabachetti and his work at Crea I have already
referred the reader, does not mention it.&nbsp; Tabachetti left
his native Dinant in 1585, and from that date until his death in
1615 he appears to have worked chiefly at Varallo and Crea.&nbsp;
There is a document in existence stating that in 1588 he executed
a statue for the hermitage of S. Rocco, at Crea, which, if it is
to be relied on, disposes both of the incarceration and of the
visit to Saas.&nbsp; It is possible, however, that the date is
1598, in which case Butler&rsquo;s theory of the visit to Saas
may hold good.&nbsp; In 1590 Tabachetti was certainly at Varallo,
and again in 1594, 1599, and 1602.&nbsp; He died in 1615,
possibly during a visit to Varallo, though his home at that time
was Costigliole, near Asti.&mdash;R. A. S.</p>

Marine Biological Laboratory, Plymouth, has called my attention
to the fact that I have ascribed to Professor Ray Lankester a
criticism on Mr. Wallace&rsquo;s remarks upon the eyes of certain
fiat-fish, which Professor Ray Lankester was, in reality, only
adopting&mdash;with full acknowledgment&mdash;from Mr.
Cunningham.&nbsp; Mr. Cunningham has left it to me whether to
correct my omission publicly or not, but he would so plainly
prefer my doing so that I consider myself bound to insert this
note.&nbsp; Curiously enough I find that in my book
&ldquo;Evolution Old and New,&rdquo; I gave what Lamarck actually
said upon the eyes of flat-fish, and having been led to return to
the subject, I may as well quote his words.&nbsp; He
wrote:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Need&mdash;always occasioned by the circumstances in
which an animal is placed, and followed by sustained efforts at
gratification&mdash;can not only modify an organ&mdash;that is to
say, augment or reduce it&mdash;but can change its position when
the case requires its removal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ocean fishes have occasion to see what is on either
side of them, and have their eyes accordingly placed on either
side of their head.&nbsp; Some fishes, however, have their abode
near coasts on submarine banks and inclinations, and are thus
forced to flatten themselves as much as possible in order to get
as near as they can to the shore.&nbsp; In this situation they
receive more light from above than from below, and find it
necessary to pay attention to whatever happens to be above them;
this need has involved the displacement of their eyes, which now
take the remarkable position which we observe in the case of
soles, turbots, plaice, &amp;c.&nbsp; The transfer of position is
not even yet complete in the case of these fishes, and the eyes
are not, therefore, symmetrically placed; but they are so with
the skate, whose head and whole body are equally disposed on
either side a longitudinal section.&nbsp; Hence the eyes of this
fish are placed symmetrically upon the uppermost
<i>side</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Philosophie Zoologique</i>, tom. i.,

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
